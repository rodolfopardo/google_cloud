Aw shoot. I spent days trying to figure out why my Ruby app can't stream Server Sent Events on Google Cloud Run.
 
 The cause? Puma sets TCP_CORK until the request is complete. Normal Linux flushes data regularly, Cloud Run waits until socket is uncorked.

 iCloud data is encrypted by Apple on Google Cloud with an Apple-owned key, so they can decrypt it. Hopefully there is no root password there.
 
 iCloud Keychain should be E2E, so safe?

 "Slackからコンテンツを確実にインデックスし、Google Cloud Searchでインテリジェントに検索するためのセキュアなエンタープライズサーチコネクターです。Slackのすべてのパブリックチャンネルからのメッセージ、スレッド、共有ファイルをほぼリアルタイムで堅牢にインデックスします。"
過去何回か血眼になって探したけど、Google Cloud SearchでSlackの投稿やファイルも検索対象に含める方法は、このプロダクトを使うか自前開発しかなさそう。もっと競争があっても良いと思うんだけど、そもそもニーズ少ないのかな🙄

@graemeblackwood I mean $EOS did just announce a partnership with google cloud, that google cloud published themselves saying so while I kind of agree with you’re saying but you might be just as misinformed as well, just saying.
@NetLijon @graemeblackwood I’m confused on who you’re responding to but EOS is up 100% since April when Google Cloud released their article and the project is getting a lot more active in news and engagement. So if it is directed towards me, that’s price action and fundamental action 🤷‍♂️

@LitmusPaperTest You're incorrect on multiple points, all Band nodes rely on a single cloud function managed by a single Google cloud account on a single web hosting provider in a single geographic location
 
 That is centralized to the extreme degree because a single entity controls the function
@LitmusPaperTest Who controls the google cloud account that manages the cloud function? What happens if they turn it off? If the function is DDoSed with requests and maxes out the API limit of the data providers? If they forget to pay the cloud bill? You haven't thought this all the way through
@LitmusPaperTest And I'm not talking about DDoSing the cloud function itself, I'm talking about DDoSing the data providers the cloud function connects to by maxing out their API limit 
 
 The Google cloud function is an open API that anybody can call as many times as they want
@ChainLinkGod Again please see how Google cloud functions work.
@ChainLinkGod You realize how cheap are google's cloud bills. And at the scale that band is operating they already have multi year contracts for using Google cloud.
@ChainLinkGod Again. Why would band decide to manipulate? I don't see any incentive for that. And google cloud API is a facade interface that makes it easier to get the data. Any other entity can verify that data coming from band nodes and API interface matches.

@anybodyapps Couldnt build it with nocode. There exists solution to use Python to overlay audio files, to run Python script requires uses of another engine such as Google cloud , which defeats the purpose of building with no code.

🍃🌿☁️New from me: just how environmentally friendly are the cloud providers? They all make great play of their green credentials, but data centres remain big sources of carbon emissions: https://t.co/voLZZi43Zu
Google is at least attempting some transparency around the carbon emissions of its cloud data centres. As you'll see in the piece, a lot of information is available publicly online. The others don't do this: https://t.co/voLZZi43Zu
Amazon's AWS seems particularly behind the curve on net-zero, but it does buy a lot of renewable energy: https://t.co/voLZZi43Zu
The solution? Perhaps it's greater auditing as per the automotive industry, where emissions are monitored and standards have to be met. No such thing currently exists for data centres: https://t.co/voLZZi43Zu

ここのプロダクトで入れたい物は全て交えてインフラ作れたかも、、となると、単に分析を伝えるチャネルを広げる、とのスタンスになりそうだ
 
 GCP の無料枠 - 無料の長期トライアル、Always Free | Google Cloud : https://t.co/8h9XK4frEf
Statcastデータがフリーな理由、データ収集から加工、分析、配信までオートマチックに行えるインフラが作り上げられているから、とのイメージ。AWSからGoogle Cloudへシフトしたのも、人力のメンテナンスコストをより下げるべく、マネージドサービスに加工・分析を任せたかったんじゃねーかと
旧アーキテクチャ（AWS上に立っていたStatcast）からオートマチックに回る形が作られていたので、さらなる人力コストカットを求めてGoogle Cloudへ行った、と見て良いかなーと

I shared recently @googlecloud published carbon-free energy %s for our cloud regions. Now we created a DOPE region picker tool that lets you optimize between:
 
 🍃Lower carbon footprint
 💲Price
 ⏱And latency
 
 It'll suggest the best regions for your needs!

 For example they use code/data for their own purpose (if Licence allows it, idk) ?
 Or it's just a big ad/demonstration of Google Cloud ?
