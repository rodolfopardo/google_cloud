Commented Video,Comment,"I&#39;m having trouble understanding why visual editors such as netbeans were abandoned. UI development for Swing, motif, awt and other toolkits were trivial. Then *poof* - we&#39;re hand-jamming an xml file and referring to it as &quot;ui code&quot;.
 
 If you&#39;re reading this, check out Netbeans and take a pass at a Swing application. You&#39;ll then share my frustration - or maybe not, since it&#39;s not likely we&#39;ll return to fast UI dev.",nothanksgoogle,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHbYIbFsYFgFmEEdR5A2Ykw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZNb1NOPTp8,0,29/9/2013 21:16:43,9,1,2013,29

Of course not! The given application is far more complicated than an example that you use to teach something to someone.

Replied Comment,Reply,"It might be wrong if it is a lie. Nothing wrong if it is true. No error here, my judgment is solid. The presenter is good-looking, that is why she is on TV and i&#39;m not. I like looking at good looking women. Very pretty. Nothing wrong saying that. I feel fine. Her explanation of the subject is a bit fast for my brains but her good looks has nothing to do with my brains. So just rewound several times until I got what the pretty women wanted me to understand. See? Win-Win!<br /><br />P.S: I guess some ugly people would not like the truth if that was discussed on a public forum. Maybe those ugly people should not post videos of themselves.

FTP: DOWNLOAD/BACKUP A COPY OF &#39;OLD&#39; FOLDER/FILE ...do the necessary editing and save the new folder/file... Test to see everything is in working condition just like you want it ;-) <br><br>7.

Commented Video,Comment,"This is a great video! It has helped me so much. I want to add something for people who might have experienced an error where their permissions were denied. All you have to to is connect to the computer either using putty or the chrome console, and type this: sudo chmod 777 -R (directory that you want to edit). This will open the permissions up for filezilla to use. <br /><br /><br />Command breakdown<br />sudo - Makes sure the command is ran as an admin<br />chmod - Allows you to edit file permissions<br />777 - Allows full read/write/run privileges <br />-R - Makes it recursive to all directories so that you dont have to do this for every file inside the directory",Dabe Co,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF_XnTel04seLizWbctUkfw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDcjM7BySo0,3,15/10/2019 17:11:41,10,3,2019,15

Commented Video,Comment,"What about how to add a second domain, when you generate a second or third domain, it gives new nameservers, such as 1st = A, 2nd = B, 3rd = C etc etc.<br /><br />So when you goto cpanel and try and add these addon domains, it says nameserver problem.<br />BUT if you change the scond name server ns-cloud-b2 to say ns-cloud-a1 to match the main instance for all 4...<br /><br />Google says:<br />Warning: Your NS records do not match the nameservers for your zone. This is not common and could cause problems.<br /><br />AND still in cpanel it says nameservers don&#39;t match.<br /><br />It seems impossible to use addon domains with Gcloud?<br /><br />Spent 3 days on it watched dozens of videos and hundreds of websites, not one will explain how to successfully add addon domains using only one VM instance + Cpanel.",Cycle Sam,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwZiF4vNPnTKnqFh6toANtg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXtqqofrhOo,0,19/6/2019 3:09:20,6,4,2019,19

Commented Video,Comment,"This is a perfect use case for cloud computing. This used to be called “batch” processing – scheduling super expensive compute resources where the output would eventually come back to the user completed – in a day, a week, who knows. God forbid the user had a parameter, a comma, out of place that made the job abort… Doh!

Replied Comment,Reply,"BigQuery is the storage and analytics in one. Because of it being designed for extremely large data sets there&#39;s a fairly heavy cost to running queries against it. If your data set is relatively small (GBs, and potentially TBs depending on schema) a query might be able to finish in the tens of seconds neighborhood. I.e. still not real time, or even real near time. You can, and what we recommend even, build some real time analytics into whichever piece is pulling the data into BigQuery. So in a Cloud Function for example.<br /><br />Grain of salt, this all depends on use case of course. If you only care about seeing reports on the data every minute, for example, you may be able to get away with using BigQuery directly, but I&#39;d still suggest using some other data warehouse for real time.<br /><br />Hopefully this helps. If you want to connect on LinkedIn if you have more questions I&#39;m happy to chat more.",Gabe Weiss,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1TBAUIhA_YH_XfiHe3OdtQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYaprBSDy8A,2,16/10/2018 12:10:33,10,3,2018,16

Was anyway able to clear it since I am mainly preparing for GCP architect certification. You really need to have good understanding and some hands on for most of the components, specially GKE, GCE and Storages. One thing I would like to mention that, there were many questions from IAM and Stackdriver, so prepare that well whoever plans to appear for ACE certification.

Replied Comment,Reply,"Hey Katie, thanks for the reply! I forgot that Cloud SQL could auto sale as well, in this case I meant Cloud Run container instances. I may be misunderstanding how Cloud Run works, but my understanding is if you have a service that would traditionally be a Django server on an IaaS setup like Google Compute Engine, you set your service concurrency to 1, and got 1000 requests, Cloud Run would boot up 1000 container instances to handle this traffic, which at least on CloudSQL for PostgreSQL would potentially be over the default max connection limit for even the the most expensive instance database instance type, as it reserves some of its connections for internal ops. Just curious if there’s a good way to deal with this without an unmanaged pgBouncer instance on between.",Aaron Free,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbMgXlkqJsOgigJXgSuvXAw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk21gaNO6ag,0,10/5/2020 21:28,5,1,2020,10

Commented Video,Comment,"Great video and great work on Cloud Run! It is by far my favorite serverless cloud service. I do have one question though. When using Cloud Run with Django, how would you manage connections for a SQL database? This is something I typically struggle with when modeling a serverless + managed SQL setup, since different spawned instances usually can&#39;t reuse each other&#39;s database connections and spawning too many instances with different connections may be hard for a SQL database to keep up with. I know that Cloud Run instances can serve a limited number of requests greater than 1, but at high(ish) scale I could still see database connection management being an issue.",Aaron Free,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbMgXlkqJsOgigJXgSuvXAw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk21gaNO6ag,2,10/3/2020 6:39,3,3,2020,10

Replied Comment,Reply,"Hola Eduardo, si puedes acceder a la raíz del servidor de varias formas SSH, FTP. No obstante con WordPress Bitnami o Click to Deploy en Google Cloud el proceso de instalar por fuera de la raíz no está disponible en proceso de instalación, para poder lograr esto tendrías que crear una instancia e instalar todo lo necesario para tener WordPress. Ahora cuando instalas WordPress utilizando Bitnami o Click to Deploy, se instala en la IP asignada para la VM Instance, podrías trabajar el sitio en esa IP, y apuntar el dominio cuando esté lista y aprobada por el cliente. Próximamente montaremos un tutorial sobre como acceder por FTP pero te recomiendo que veas este link por lo pronto (<a href=""https://www.onepagezen.com/google-cloud-ftp-filezilla-quick-start/)"">https://www.onepagezen.com/google-cloud-ftp-filezilla-quick-start/)</a>. Referente a los correos estos simplemente los configuras en la zona DNS que creaste a través de los registros MX recuerda que estos registros deben ingresarse primero la prioridad espacio y después el valor. Por defecto Google Cloud tiene deshabilitado el envío de correos por php mail, por lo cual para que tus correos desde el sitio web funcione debes instalar un plugin como WP SMTP Mail o Zoho Mail si utilizas la plataforma de Zoho.

Replied Comment,Reply,"Hola Lucas este error normalmente sucede por alguna configuración errónea en el servidor, revisa el Cloud DNS y comprueba que el valor correspondiente a la IP este correcto, así como el CNAME, después de comprobar esto debes ir a tu registrador de dominios y comprobar que los 4 Nameservers proporcionados por Google en la zona DNS estén correctos en nombre de tu dominio que quieres apuntar a Google Cloud, otra verificación que puedes hacer es realizar un ping al dominio para comprobar a que IP esta resolviendo, otra posible causa es el uso de un VPN, si es asi desactivalo y vuelve a ingresar. Otra razon podria ser algun plugin, para esto lo recomendable seria desactivarlos todos por phpMyAdmin y luego ir activando uno por uno y comprobando que todo este correcto.

If you go to google&#39;s API explorer you&#39;ll see that the Datastore API is at version 1 (<a href=""https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#search/datastore/datastore/v1/"">https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#search/datastore/datastore/v1/</a>). <br />I&#39;m building a tool that integrates with Datastore via its REST APIs and its going smoothly. Its not for everyone though; you should look into Firebase (also owned by Google) there are tonnes of tutorials out there and its easier to pick up than most. Firebase has its draw backs if you&#39;re coming from a SQL background but its good for a lot of use cases (for my current project it was a toss-up between Firebase and Datastore; we went with Datastore b/c of its support for SQL-like queries).",Dimu Designs,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRR-nMDX2Dl0oQlKWKHIuSQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmjuMyRBPO4,2,19/12/2016 14:54:18,12,2,2016,19

Commented Video,Comment,Cold Storage pricing like Amazon Glacier or Google Nearline somehow is only more cost effective in end-user archiving scenarios when having a byte-sequence of unstructured data smaller than around 600 GB. Somehow even the Google pricing calculator can&#39;t beat CrashPlan&#39;s yearly pricing. So I think neither Google nor Amazons AWS has a good alternative for what CrashPlan is to end-user archiving needs.<br /><br />for nearline (why can&#39;t we directly save to coldline?) datastreams of roughly half a million object in a sequence of roughly 1700 Gigabytes other solutions seem to be more effective if you only want to archive.,DerParadonym,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuRu3p22YfLNUUunxQPwy6g,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmjuMyRBPO4,0,21/2/2017 19:13:32,2,3,2017,21

Replied Comment,Reply,"The philosophy of Cloud Computing is to separate storage and compute power so that you can turn on and off the computing power as and when you need it. So it is advisable to use cloud storage to store your code and spin up a compute instance, use it and turn it off and persist data in cloud storage and connect to cloud storage again when you need to spin up another compute instance.

How is the real cost calculated thou? Only when a user enters the site and is browsing it? Or maybe per session time on backend, or both? Or maybe per OS running time?

Replied Comment,Reply,"Hi! Very good materials provided by you, most of them are common sense. The logic used is applied by different companies, so you do not need to be Google to have this kind of interviews. On the other hand, very dissapointed by Google Interview process. No HR involved in the interview, sales consultants are performing it and they just write what you have said but not word by word. In addition the line is dropping so the connection is bad from their side, hence all the efforts are useless.

I was told would have all 3 interviews (RRK, GCA, Leadership/Googlyness) in one day. That was back tracked and had my RRK alone. Passed that and moved onto another round the following week (RCA, I Leadership/Googlyness). I was told would get feedback from that and see what the potential next steps are.

May be a bit slow at moment but this is a test , my understing of the cloud is I can use upgrade to better hw the same VM cause I have no intention to create one vm for one website, at least I understood I can do everything on one VM and upgrade id the performance are not good. I was using in this test openlitespeed wordpress but I was in confusion for the virtual host, thats why I asked you , I thought I could use binamy in case I could not fix my issue, in any case I fixed this morning after having watched your video making new test so thanks again for your kind reply, at present I will go on on my deployment, cheers !",Fabrizio Del Tufo,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCamezXPftv7I9Asr0C-xMsQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG9kv5-5bPI,1,9/8/2020 9:20,8,1,2020,9

Replied Comment,Reply,"Hi Amanda, 100%, yes. Once you setup Wordpress, it will be exactly like if you hosted anywhere else! Now, there are a few things to consider here #1 the Free Tier allows up to 1GB of data egress (meaning data downloaded to your viewers), if you go over 1GB, then it&#39;s $0.12 per GB. The other thing to consider is #2: if you have LOTS of visitors like 1500 visits a day, then you will need to upgrade your Virtual Machine to handle the additional simultaneous load. But honestly, if you host ANYWHERE if you get this kind of traffic, they will make upgrade your hosting package as well. Also, if you&#39;re getting that many visitors, you&#39;ll be making lots and lots of money and can afford to upgrade your Google Cloud Virtual Machine to provide you customer a smoother experience.

Replied Comment,Reply,"Hi Yogendran Ganesan. Thanks for checking out the video. I did a bad job explaining this point, here let me try again: Google gives you $300 Free credit to use in the first year. Also, I discuss how to configure your Bitnami WordPress Deployment so that you can take advantage of Google Free Tier (basically using the f1-micro CPU in specific regions). So even after the first year, you&#39;re only paying about $0.50 a month for it (actual cost varies based on how much traffic you get). The Bitnami wordpress estimate cost is not correct, since they don&#39;t factor in that we are setting up to take advantage of the Free Tier. Please let me know if you have any questions.

However, I recommend creating a second GCP account to host the other site separately. So that you can take advantage of the Free Tier for each site.

Replied Comment,Reply,"Hi DJ Only-Vibe! Thanks for your comment, GCP really can be 100% FREE. GCP has a generous free tier (please see the break down here: <a href=""https://youtu.be/fJJL9icHCxY?t=65"">https://youtu.be/fJJL9icHCxY?t=65</a> ). I have been running several websites running this way for almost two years now. But you need to keep an eye on your egress data. We have a Learning Management System website (www.PixelStabbers.com) that is still perfectly fine on the free tier. For our other websites that have more static content like <a href=""http://utechpia.com/"">UTECHPIA.com</a> and <a href=""http://kidphotofun.com/"">KidPhotoFun.com</a> those Websites are way under the minimum of the GCP’s free tier.

Replied Comment,Reply,"Hi BkbnFS! Thanks for your comment, GCP really can be 100% FREE. GCP has a generous free tier (please see the break down here: <a href=""https://youtu.be/fJJL9icHCxY?t=65"">https://youtu.be/fJJL9icHCxY?t=65</a> ). I have been running several websites running this way for almost two years now. But you need to keep an eye on your egress data. We have a Learning Management System website (www.PixelStabbers.com) that is still perfectly fine on the free tier. For our other websites that have more static content like <a href=""http://utechpia.com/"">UTECHPIA.com</a> and <a href=""http://kidphotofun.com/"">KidPhotoFun.com</a> those Websites are way under the minimum of the GCP’s free tier.

Commented Video,Comment,"Thank you, for the video, first of all. I have a dilemma. I had a real bad webhost who sent my website in a zip file. I was not quick to get it renewed my domain name. I went with two webhosts. The second one was going to migrate my site for free, till they found out I have a .net, instead of a .com, same name, and all. They said that I would have to clone it, and that is not free to do with them. Should I try to retrieve my site, it has like 6-7 subdomains, also. Should I purchase a .com, or a .co, from namecheap, or google, and try to do it, again. However, I still cannot even open it in google drive. I had gotten so discouraged, that it took me, a very long time, to even trust, another webhost. I am not sure, if I should give up on my project, for if I did not have a lot of wasted good content on it. It is absurd, but it is up from hundreds, to thousands, of dollars, for anyone to buy. It is very scary because now I do have a website actually two of them, with my name on them, perhaps something that I might regret later on down the road. What are your suggestions?

As a developer, I don&#39;t want to manage kubernetes through a manifest, I have my smooth running docker images and just want to run them and let the cloud provider deal with the logistics and give me a nice web or platform UI that lets me &quot;tune&quot; how the containers run.

Honestly - it&#39;s an absolutely amazing tool, using something like &quot;Cloud Run&quot; feels like a step-back sometimes, like you are trying to get back control of your customers. GKE is such a perfect middle-ground between &quot;do it yourself&quot; and &quot;fully hosted&quot; option - I&#39;m not even sure there could be any product that would make it sensible to switch to something else. Any &quot;auxiliary&quot; tools, like CloudRegistry, Logging, Debug, Cloud Code are highly appreciated, but K8S API definitely MUST be the core part of it - and no one will be giving away that much of control, now since we&#39;ve seen what&#39;s possible!",a l,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyuo9sKMV-_8OoP_aftcf9A,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh0fPT-AWwM,2,1/5/2020 14:50,5,6,2020,1

Big query, cloud spanner<br />...<br />...<br />And you’d have to pick the best setup based on the information.

Replied Comment,Reply,"A data engineer builds applications with data pipelines at the heart of them. From collecting data to manipulating data to using data to drive insight. A data engineer could be responsible for the whole pipeline or a single piece (in a team with other engineers). The cert alone is great but having a project/experience to back up the certificate is even better. You should always favour experience (such as, working on your own projects) over certifications.",Daniel Bourke,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr8O8l5cCX85Oem1d18EezQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bedzsHNSKnA,1,10/11/2019 8:38,11,1,2019,10

Replied Comment,Reply,"@Daniel Bourke The optimization I&#39;m talking about is like what you said, best route between two points with an objective, like best route using minimum fuel or minimum time. <br />Differs from ML because in ML the objective is modeling a precise prediction, optimization is about trimming a problem to a mathematical basis to find the optimal solution.<br /><br />Recently I found a ML approach to optimization in pricing, they train a model to predict sales and experiment different prices in the test data to compare which prices produces the best profit overtime. <br /><br />After asking to you I did some search in udemy and found a nice course on the subject: <a href=""https://www.udemy.com/course/optimization-with-metaheuristics/"">https://www.udemy.com/course/optimization-with-metaheuristics/</a><br /><br />I asked because I thought it was interesting knowledge to use in data science, and I&#39;ve seen few approaches using it. <br />Thank you",Rodrigo Soares,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0wKC8jAs04xnAVFkiTWCXQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bedzsHNSKnA,0,28/9/2020 10:25:22,9,2,2020,28

Commented Video,Comment,"Great video as usual. I cleared the exam this morning.. Exam tips and resources i used.
 <br />I followed course from Pluralsight, which pretty much covers everything for data engineer exam.
 <br />I additionally used Skillcertpro exam questions for practice. They have around 541 questions. Evaluate yourself by scoring above 85% in these tests before attempting real exam. Most of these questions are very identical to real exam, which helped me to score higher in my main exam,
 <br />All questions comes with detailed explanation at the end. Review them. retake tests multiple times if you&#39;re scoring below 85%. because practicing exam questions is key for passing the real exam. 
 <br />I hope this helps anyone who is planning for certification.

Replied Comment,Reply,Suppose you have a claim application where employee raise claims. It is required to integrate claims application with SAP. SAP provides Rest API endpoint for integration.<br />Once claims are approved those claims should be uploaded to SAP at night. <br />You can use Google workflows to get claims from your claim application and then post those claims to SAP each night. <br />First you will create a step in workflow that will read all approved claims from the claim app database.<br />Then for each claim or you can even batch them and then you will post those claims to SAP. <br />Basically this use case is integrating two application: claim app and SAP.,Ajay Wadhawan,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyNTTu11yWoNl0pC1bus9qQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOTFhWpjrFI,1,2/8/2021 7:01,8,2,2021,2

Para poder hacerlo te recomiendo que instales otro microservicio con un nginx y debtro del nginx instales el certbot. El nginx debe funcionar como un proxi reverso.

Referente Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure y Google Cloud, todos son servicios similares, el que tiene hasta ahora mayor porción del mercado es Amazon pero cada ves mas Azure y Google Cloud ganan una mayor cuota de mercado.

Si alguien tiene problemas con el password temporal de Bitnami (login user y un password temporal que aparentemente no sirve para entrar a la consola de admin de wordpress, es porque cuando le das click al link que te da google cloud para entrar al panel de admin directamente lleva basura en el url. solo copia el url sin darle click y ponlo directamente en la barra de direcciones del navegador y asi funciona todo sin problemas.

Si prestas atención en el video indico que esta configuración, la que se indica en el video, se respetan todas las características para poder usar el VPS en modo gratuito hasta que algún día Google cambie las políticas. Para un ejemplo mejor, si estas mismas características las utilizas en una zona diferente a las indicas vas a tener un costo. El crédito es como dices tu y como se indica en el video. Pero si prestas atención, ese crédito no está activado aún, así que tampoco está siendo utilizado hasta que se active manualmente. De todos modos va en tí si quieres utilizar esto o no, conociendo todas las limitaciones que tiene algo gratis.

También debes tener en cuenta la capacidad de datos, tienes solamente 30 GB de los cuales el sistema te va a consumir unos 8GB seguramente.

Esto quiere decir que en los 90 días vas a poder utilizar todos los productos ofrecidos y se te descontarán los valores excedentes del mes de los 300 dólares. Si gastas los 300 dólares antes de los 90 días los servicios funcionarán dentro de los recursos incluídos y se suspenderán hasta comenzar el nuevo mes.<br />Una vez que terminaste los 90 días solamente puedes utilizar los servicios que respeten las cuotas incluídas mensualmente, como en el caso del VPS. Lo que excedas se cobrará.<br />Espero haber podido evacuar tus dudas. <br />Ya viste el último video? En Oracle se pueden obtener VPS gratis mas potentes y sin tantas restricciones.<br /><br />Si fue de ayuda lo que encontraste en el canal espero tu suscripción. Me ayudas mucho con tu apoyo para poder seguir creciendo.<br /><br />Saludos!",Apuntes IT,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh_k8K1wP31GfOFdYJj5Eeg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5bOB5e9XjQ,1,27/3/2021 21:08:37,3,7,2021,27

Commented Video,Comment,"Hola Hola , muy práctico el tutorial y lo mejor en chileno jeje. <br />Pero tengo una duda que me salió en comparativa a otros tutoriales. <br />¿Por qué recomiendas el despliegue de wordpress bajo la modalidad de kubernetes?? Este es el primer tutorial de todos los que he visto en que el despliegue para WP y GCP se hace en kubernetes y no bajo la imagen de VM clásica. No soy muy experto porque no soy del área de TI y recien estoy aprendiendo con WP... Pero me surgió esta duda al ver tu despliegue. Según lo que he leído, la API de kubernetes se usa para grandes proyectos que necesiten clústeres de trabajo, cosa que no me imagino con un pequeño comercio, el que se podría gestionar con VMs escalables en caso de necesitar más recursos. La única conjetura que imagino es que kubernetes es mejor por costos (para después del año gratis). Sin embargo tampoco encuentro la tarifa de kubernetes explícita como por ejemplo las tarifas que salen en los despliegues con VM (donde te muestran un costo de $XX, simulado por mes y espacio de disco). Bueno igual escribí montones jasjjs .. pero la duda es ¿Por qué para una tienda pequeña sería mejor esta imagen y una estructura kubernete ?",Fex C.,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCahUBGL8A-x-BeOIXJloqoQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWzgG4qoNIo,0,26/6/2020 4:11:23,6,6,2020,26

Replied Comment,Reply,"@mikigaymer Clashofclan por lo que leo en esta cadena también eres ​ @José Miguel Lebrero Nunez Desconozco que cosa quieres hacer para no poner tus datos reales en la cuenta de pago. Pero por empezar te aconsejo que trates de no mezclar las cuentas porque va a ser sencillo de vincularte. Por otro lado, si quieres sacar una cuenta de usuario con otra residencia deberías usar una VPN para poder elegir desde donde conectar la cuenta. Pero mas allá de todo eso, la tarjeta de crédito o débito que utilices para vincular la cuenta te va a identificar con tu residencia postal por lo que supongo que si hay alguna reglamentación financiera en particular entre Google y España, te van a seguir pidiendo datos extras. Y si detectan maniobras sospechosas como estas que te comento y las que planteas creo que te vas a comprar un problema. Fijate en la cadena de comentarios que contesté a otro visitante un sitio web donde puedes sacar una tarjeta de crédito virtual con la que puedes abrir tu cuenta en GCP.
