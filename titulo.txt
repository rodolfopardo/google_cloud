@Ryan looks like you&#39;ve totally revamped the experience now! The new cloud console looks great.. I&#39;m going to have to give this a try right away!
I m quiet a newbie, but who knows maybe someone can help. Despite the doc, I didn&#39;t understand how to Upload and Download Data with bulkloader.yaml file in the tutorial. I&#39;m stuck there
very informative, will definitely give it a try
2:38 not bad
She MUST be an Android! There is no other explanation.
true true.. I am trying now to use them again.. for example parse.com is 10 x better for mobile apps.. I can integrate it in 1 min...
I&#39;m having trouble understanding why visual editors such as netbeans were abandoned. UI development for Swing, motif, awt and other toolkits were trivial. Then *poof* - we&#39;re hand-jamming an xml file and referring to it as &quot;ui code&quot;.
 
 If you&#39;re reading this, check out Netbeans and take a pass at a Swing application. You&#39;ll then share my frustration - or maybe not, since it&#39;s not likely we&#39;ll return to fast UI dev.

Am I the only one who has no idea what shes talking about? Why the 136 thumbs up? She talks to fast and every other word, I never heard of before. I want drag and drop, please. My degree is in drag and drop applications.
so I guess this is not for you. Google Cloud Platform is a tool for Developers, not drag &#39;n droppers :)
You are more to welcome to join an engineering school, and then you see how many pretty eng-girls are studying there, to become &quot;someone&quot; in their live ;) Not such a BS ...
she&#39;s obviously just reading from a teleprompter
Finally, someone that can speak at a pace that keeps me engaged. Keep up the good work.
can we know the whole procedure in a document please so that we can refer that step by step
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?
I have a financial calculator in excel. How would I convert it to an android application
I&#39;ve been doing in the example that suggests Google and I could make it work the GCM in the emulator, but when I try to put it to work on my tablet I export the apk file to the GCM server connects but does not seem to recognize my tablet, but the emulator works well, someone can help me
So rude
@Amy&#39;s Gaming no he&#39;s right they don&#39;t simplify topics so normal people can understand instead they use technical language
@Programmer for Life <br /><br />HD h
Not meant for you.
it was the worst tutorial I&#39;ve ever seen. simply I understood nothing. thank you google.
Wait what
This looks more current: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/developers/articles/mobile-backend-starter">https://cloud.google.com/developers/articles/mobile-backend-starter</a>
i need something like visual basic but for android or windows phone.......look my home made javascript game ide at my canal hi
@sharpezor omg hahah
What was that about putting my package in the back end?
You read the teleprompter very well
Url Not working at 5.10
This is just absurd. No passion whatsover. Please get a proper developer to explain this.
PATHETIC. Google you&#39;re slipping badly with horrid tutorials like this.
Finally something that is more useful than the video
Thank you very much for this introduction. <br />I was able to find tutorial source code from github, <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/solutions-mobile-shopping-assistant-android-client">https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/solutions-mobile-shopping-assistant-android-client</a>, as a good starting point. <br />And also installed Google plug-in for my Eclipse (Juno), <a href="https://developers.google.com/eclipse/docs/install-eclipse-4.2">https://developers.google.com/eclipse/docs/install-eclipse-4.2</a><br />Also noticed that I needed to updated [Extras] using Android SDK Manager.<br />It took me more than 30 minutes to prepare necessary working environment, very educational. <br />I like this video!
@Rob L Very Very True :| <br />I am actually very angry after watching this.<br />No problem. I will learn all from scratch :|.<br />Bad Laura :(
@Rob L that&#39;s right. but I guess they wanted it to look like a promo or trailer of how engine would work and a quick workthrough. It was not a tutorial.
Not made for you.
Rob L But But.... it has nice cheerful music and a bubbly teacher so in the tech world it was ok! Wheeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!
Sorry, but this tutorial was absolutely terrible. Nothing was explained clearly. Who could honestly say they understand it better after watching this!?
got auto focused on the blue thing, not the saying...
Ok, there are 5 minutes, but this isn&#39;t clear if you want to learn how to put information in your database in the cloud and print it in your app. Google, your explanations about your APIS are disappointing me :/
You can&#39;t even run an application like that since no business logic was described in the JDBC server.
Terrible tutorial. Should have used the &quot;Bake a Cake&quot; model. Tell me what tools I need to have in place and downloaded. To much is assumed here. Not everyone uses Eclipse. Although I think it is the best for organization of a project.
First: I don&#39;t know why this has anything to do with being a girl. This is just a bad tutorial.<br />Second: It is not only about this video tutorial. Google tutorials sock. I put almost 2 days to follow the text version of this tutorial [link bellow] and after all vague explanations and me being passed from one link to another, that drove me crazy, eventually, here I am with a working application (Mobile Shopping Assistant) but did it help me to understand how I can start my own application? Of course not! The given application is far more complicated than an example that you use to teach something to someone. And exactly the moment that you want to see how data were put on cloud or where those methods get there, the tutorial is finished!!!<br />[<a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/mobile/how-to-build-mobile-app-with-app-engine-backend-tutorial/">https://cloud.google.com/solutions/mobile/how-to-build-mobile-app-with-app-engine-backend-tutorial/</a>]
thk
If only at was free, I would make an app with google cloud included as standard.
I consider myself IT savvy but after watching this i was like... wtf lol I am going to look for something easier to follow
OK!! very clear !! viva apps with google cloud
Very informative video, thank you so much! <br /><br />Not srs. Literally the worst POS video i&#39;ve ever seen.
Said a whole lot but said nothing. Complete waist of time.

#ERROR!
Nothing wrong if you say that someone is pretty in a public internet forum. You might consider it impolite or rude but that is not handled by medicine or shrinks.
It might be wrong if it is a lie. Nothing wrong if it is true. No error here, my judgment is solid. The presenter is good-looking, that is why she is on TV and i&#39;m not. I like looking at good looking women. Very pretty. Nothing wrong saying that. I feel fine. Her explanation of the subject is a bit fast for my brains but her good looks has nothing to do with my brains. So just rewound several times until I got what the pretty women wanted me to understand. See? Win-Win!<br /><br />P.S: I guess some ugly people would not like the truth if that was discussed on a public forum. Maybe those ugly people should not post videos of themselves. They will probably feel bad.
#ERROR!
That was an ultimate thug life comment 😎
This is a technical introductory video competently presented by a good speaker. Everything else is irrelevant. If you feel that you need to comment about the presenter gender or look, please, consider getting psychological advice.
#ERROR!
I was a newbie ! not know if this course will help me or not ! I want just to tell you .. just follow that guy and you will make a great app!<br />to encourage you, I made this one : <br /><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.campermasterapp.tankinwars">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.campermasterapp.tankinwars</a><br />Yes ! it takes time ! but it&#39;s super easy !<br /><br />I encourage you ! so please encourage me by adding a review with 5 stars :)<br />If you made app too ! and you publish it !

Google really knows how to make you click ;P
Me too LOL
I can copy paster faster xD
Lovely brown eyes n brown hair ... what a distraction ... hmm
it seems as at least you are understanding she is reading out laud .
which are most the popular cloud components for android/ios apps
dear google I am not getting any way to subscribe any account here in YouTube. please help me out.
She is just reading this really SUCKS google.
I see lots of people keep on speaking about Devomobiron Secrets (just google search it). But Im uncertain if it is good. Have you ever tried this popular make money iphone &amp; android apps creation step by step?
Luka Luksic u know something about 300 hundred credit
haha, nothing Ive learned, but she probably needs to be seen here, why not?
Where are the files for download to try it out.
confusing
agggghh.. I do not know if it is her voice or it is just confusing. If you really want to lay out the message be more specific and please change the speaker. I do not want to see a beautiful model I want someone who can explain this process.
Sara Bareilles developer version!
Any body explain me what did she explained???? 😇😇
😉😇😥😇😇😁😁😁
I didn&#39;t understand anything! Please make new video. Nothing explained in this video
I thought it was only me not understanding anything until I scroll down
Hai long. Thank you
The comments section is cancer. Don&#39;t scroll down, you have been warned.
Hello people. My 3 cents... <br />1- She&#39;s young, beautiful and she speaks our language, so... A+, she did her part well, 135k views... <br />2- It&#39;s not a tutorial, is more of a &quot;Did you know that you can...?&quot; kind of thing... <br />3- A word to the wise is enough...
As bad as this was, it&#39;s not her fault. She&#39;s just reading a bunch of words! I&#39;m a little disappointed in Google though! I wasn&#39;t expecting to get much out of a 5 minute video, but I got literally nothing from all that :)
I think this is a bit too high for me...I am just 11 years old
Chicken?
Hello Good Luck Happy Happiness
Thats why I love wix, they let all this kind of complicated things at their end
George Bush !! Sorry people, I could not help myself!! Lol!! ☻
Can I get a pdf of this tutorial plz....
Im lost thank you now i hate programming
Eww java
Google developers had booth babe explain super fast as they are moving to their next thing.
What the hell is going on
Is this in English??
the tutorial concludes nothing except seeing a beautiful girl
A Good try, but when you impart the knowledge assume the leaner is the starter. and kindly plan it well to state the information. Good Luck
Did you know that every new technology takes time to learn, and read, and practice in order to be productive?
TOO BAD
I&#39;m distracted on her beauty, I love her!!!
I can listen to her all day.
thanks for your knowledge, God bless
This is really a bad tutorial... No information is conveyed..
its amazing for me sir ....nice video for us thx
 <br />we also have this services <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23GSuiteGoogleEmailHosting">#GSuiteGoogleEmailHosting</a>
What is her name?
Unable to understand the accent. The voice is not clear. Can&#39;t understand the words she&#39;s speaking in English. I wish she was slow in talking, She&#39;s too fast that makes the video useless for people who are new to technical things.
Extremely poor video. The quality is very,vary bad. Google must improve their standard.

Nice! I will be happy to follow and learn from you. (=<br /><br />By the way, is it possible if i can have your advice in this open source android app I have posted below? I am still a beginner and many things to learn.

Thanks for sharing such a piece of interesting information. I am sure people over the network will love and enjoy it like I did.
Way to go man! It is something i&#39;m looking towards! App is always a good things to discuss. <br /><br />Anyway, is it ok if i can get your advice on these android app I have posted below?

Hey can you plz help how to make a software to create math question paper
lols because 2010 humans have about 2000 times less concentrated eye contact and still eyes than 1970 humans because they spend 10 hours a day on videos :D
what are the prerequisites for this tutorial to understand it and apply
Cloud app work in the deep sea or not
Explain How to upload video to google drive and communication by firebase and open it by android studio
Nothing useful was mentioned in this video :)
so can this be sort of an alternative to using android studio for adding google ads?

7 years ago damn
Awesome
It seems like it is not listed (yet) on the GCP product page, but documentation can be found at <a href="https://cloud.google.com/api-gateway/docs">https://cloud.google.com/api-gateway/docs</a><br>For now it looks very similar to the already existing Google Cloud Endpoints and I struggle to find the key differences
@Wilfred van der Deijl Yes! If you are using one function. But let&#39;s say you have multiple functions with each different functionality..you can create one end point and access multiple functions as opposed to calling them individually. Also, hopefully they will have caching and canary deployments etc in future.
Where to use it and y
Sad to see that you are still using swagger 2.0. When can we expect to see OpenAPI v3? We are waiting for OAS3 for almost 2.5 years now: <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/78271318">https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/78271318</a>
Makkara Kuski but much more affordable. Apigee costs serious $$$
yes,
Is this something similar to Apigee?
I have the exact same problem
Try enabling using gcloud cli
It shows as loading forever, but if you refresh the page, the API is already enabled. Somehow the UI doesn&#39;t get refreshed by itself :)
Enabling the &quot;API Gateway API&quot; will load forever and not succeed...
cost: kubernetes engine costs ~100usd/month and then you pay for the machines.<br><br>loadbalancer also costs $20/month plus the network transfer.<br><br>cloud run + apigateway is almost free - you only pay for the isage.<br><br>also because its and API gateway it has API key management and traffic limiting built-i
It&#39;s the same as Apigee. Apigee is more enterprise focused and is super expensive. API Gateway is for smaller scale deployments. Not sure about cloud endpoints though.
How is this different from Cloud Endpoints and Apigee?
does this support websocket like AWS API Gateway ?
Google Cloud Team, it is so confusing. What is the difference between API Gateway, Load Balancer and Cloud Endpoints? And what about Apigee ?
How do you manage the open api spec on environments with CI/CD in mind?. Knowing that every service is isolated from the others, looks complex or am i missing something?
Great Explainer
Hi Harry, your comment just makes my day. I believe teaching is one of the best ways to learn. And I try my best to explain a difficult concept so everyone can understand it. I live my life with this quote:<br><br>&quot;If you can&#39;t explain it simply, you don&#39;t understand it well enough.&quot; - Albert Einstein
thank you so much. For a non tech guy, I can understand your first 2 videos and here I am watching your 3rd video.
Hi Vannesa, there are a couple of ways to integrate Github with Airflow. For example, you can use Github to organize Airflow dags and tasks for multiple projects, or automatically deploy new dags to Airflow environment, ... I will share those use cases in a future tutorial.
@Tuan Vu very much looking forward to it ! :)
Hi this is very helpful! However I wonder how to integrate github repository with apache airflow, would you mind sharing the tutorial on that?
Should have shown the open source version instead.
how is it different from https load balancer? Or microservices would be running in kubernetes anyhow, why not use the ingress gateway or better yet, an Istio ingress gateway ?
did you white list composer to access postgres? simple way would be to just use <a href="http://0.0.0.0/">0.0.0.0</a> as allowed incoming traffic. You can do this via Clousql UI
Thank you for making these videos! I am having a problem with connecting cloud composer to cloud sql (postgres). It would be great if you can do a tutorial on that.
Yes
@Tuan Vu i meant can i use it with my free gcp account ?
Is it free ?
Awesome Video for the beginners. Thank you so much
Is permissions management still an issue with Airflow in 2020?
Thanks for sharing.
no -- composer and docker solve different problems.
does Google Cloud Composer replaces Docker?
can&#39;t thank you enough for keeping thing that simple..you are amazing ....your style of teaching doesn&#39;t make anyone realize if they are learning some high tech science.
Amazing tutorials
Depends on what your hosting case is. If you&#39;re looking at uploading images and you&#39;re making them public, then a CDN can help make sure everyone has low-latency access and it&#39;s easy to set up: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/adding-a-backend-bucket-to-content-based-load-balancing">https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/adding-a-backend-bucket-to-content-based-load-balancing</a>
If you&#39;re hosting a static site, there&#39;s no reason not to use Cloudflare in front of the bucket.
@Trevor Spencer there might be plenty of reasons not to use Cloudflare, one is price.
Do you recommend adding a CDN in front of the bucket?
Buddy, you are brilliant. perfect even... is there a way I can make my mp3 public without opening a new window?
Choose a region close to you, unless you have other services that need to be colocated. It will work in any region though.
If I&#39;m not in US should I out US east 1
Yes, that&#39;s what I need to do. Using the API...
can you sell me one account i will buy for you 5$ paypal
great video. Thanks! I subscribed
Thanks! Great demo :) Can you perhaps point to an example where this is scripted?
Yes, I record most of my videos on a mac.
are u using mac?
i see only black screen
thanks for your tutorial. may i ask how to setup the Apache by using xampp in windows server 2016?<br />I founded it, but it only worked for internal network. <br />It worked normally by IP: <a href="http://127.0.0.1/">127.0.0.1</a> or in internal IP, but not for external IP whether using the instance or external PC.<br />It seems that DMZ function can solve it, but i don&#39;t know how to do. =(
Sorry it took me so long to reply, but yes the easiest way to install software on the VM is to install Chrome (or browser of your choice) and then download and install.
how do i install programms on the vm? do i download it from a browser within the machine or put it in the basket? if basket, please do a tutorial on it.
If you create a VM in the Google cloud it will persist all of the data. Since it is a VM you can configure it with any software that you could install on a physical machine for antivirus and encryption.
Thank you for your reply. I appreciate that ! I would love to use Google Cloud Platform on Dex when I get one.
So if you save an application in your demo and start it again after a few days, will it still be in there? Also, do you know how secure the OS is? Can you encrypt the data, open the firewall and download an antimalware software? Thank you very much!
Google changes for their virtual machines by the second. You can check out the pricing model here: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pricing/">https://cloud.google.com/pricing/</a>
Does google chargers me by the hour or by the month
Dont do it
Yes, you can add Andriod Studio to a VM, but you can&#39;t run the emulator there. I also use a site called Papserspace tha has some cheap Windows VMs that I use for development here is a link for a free trial if you want to try it out. <a href="https://www.paperspace.com/&amp;R=L6IM7S">https://www.paperspace.com/&amp;R=L6IM7S</a>
can GCP Compute Engine used for running an app like Android Studio? I have a REALLY REALLY low budget PC but I want to develop app through Cloud VM
It has fast internet connection, probably faster than yours. The server and vps is managed by Google data centre, so it uses Google WiFi which is really fast
@Random Guy u know why i dont have acces to may sites? im try download google chorme but i cant
so does the vm have faster internet for downloads and uploads? or does it use our own internet to do that
Hello, I also work fulltime for Linux Academy, check out our new Cloud Playground. We build this for our enterprise customers that have this problem. You can check us out at: <a href="http://linuxacademy.com/">http://linuxacademy.com</a> (Ask your boss to buy a subscription, we have tons of hands-on labs for certifications at a great price.) Sorry if this is a sales-like reply but our labs are great for what you are trying to do!
RDP is block at work, is there a way to access via a web portal? I’ve seen AWS have a workspace accessible via a web page. Trying to run a lab of routers and switches for learning purposes when work is slow.
nice and helpful video!
Whats specs should i choose that equal to these specs? <br />Quad-core 3 GHz <br />8GB RAM<br />Nvidia or AMD/ATI <br />2GB VRAM<br />Windows 7/8/8.1/10
Thank you
Very helpful information you have there Justin. Do you know if the VM on Google Cloud runs Windows 10?
Just giving an example you can play around with the internal settings or structure of the OS. Like how windows function in the core etc. Or you practice Cyber Security, test your apps on different memory and cpu power to see how it works under different conditions and several more advantages. You can search on google for this.... and yeah IK this is a very late reply but ehh
They are very flexible and you don’t have to pay for physical infrastructure in your own data center which is very expensive. You can create them in minutes and delete them when you are done with them.
@Destin Learning thanks for the reply but you need a physical device to access them? what is the point? Not trying to be funny here.
These are generally used for servers that are accessed by hundreds it not thousands of users.
@Destin Learning so a server purposes, is that the only advantage?
somebody please give me an example on why an online virtual machine is beneficial? I am struggling to think of a use for this. That being said i am very interested in virtual machines. thanks.
Yes
Would it have it&#39;s own IP ?
What is the ram for 1 vCpu

@Host Savit Hi, Can it possible for you to help with this? It will great for me if you can help me with this.
Hey, I had the same problem. what I had done is I had added my credit card details, but to use VM you need to &quot;upgrade&quot; the GCP billing section. This is just a one-click process and it doesn&#39;t charge us till we exhaust the current free credit. <br />Later after upgrading I had a problem that Mumbai zone doesn&#39;t have enough support, so I just stuck to the &quot;us central 1-a&quot; zone and it works fine now. I hope this helps.
kindly do not forget to remove your billing details post-use if you do not intend to pay post free credits are over and are just learning GCP for personal interest.
Also the date and time of the VM will be different but that&#39;s fine as long as you are not doing any time-sensitive tasks
@Dikshita Desai Hello Dikshita, Thank you Very much for your reply. It will help me.
Hi, I am stuck in the billing part for VM instances I have selected 2019 datacenter and Mumbai location, and Getting error &quot; Windows VM instances are not included with the free trial. To use them, first enable billing on your account. You&#39;ll still be able to apply your free trial credits to eligible products and services.&quot; Can you please help me?
Thanks a lot! This saved me today!

May be in a few weeks. The course is released today!
@in28minutes Cloud, DevOps and Microservices Thanks Ranga! What&#39;s the price for this certification in gcp? I am on sysops admin now from aws. Once done planning to go for this one!! And you bringing professional course for devops on aws in near future???
@Arit Chakraborty No plans for DevOps Certifications for now. You can use coupon code LAUNCH for next 48 hours!
When it will be available on business Udemy???
It covers the first 25 steps. The entire course is available on Udemy (200+ Steps). Good Luck Ritesh.
Sir, I am BIG FAN of your teaching style!<br /><br />You helped me to solve the puzzle I had for several years on SPRING framework.<br /><br />Coming back to this video, is this complete video or this is part of a series of videos on GCP-ACE?
A lot is real world scenario. Knowing just how gcp products work is not enough.
Most of the scenarios in the exam would be practical. Complete course on udemy includes Storage and Databases as well!
This is fantanstic Ranga!<br />Is there any plan to spot light on storage area( GBQ, Spanner, bucket)?<br />In the ACE exam, what is the majority of questions they ask (Theory / Practical in terms of scenarios)?
Did you take the exam?
Glad to hear this Srinivas. Good Luck with the exam!
Thank you very much Ranga for making this. I have been following your courses in udemy. I am planning to take exam by next month end
I just purchased it too. Great explanation. Tyvm.
I&#39;m sure you will. Good Luck Vijay.
Loved the way you explain things so far. Bought the full course yesterday on udemy. Hope it’ll help me ace my ACE exam 😀
Great idea. I think 2 months is good timeframe. Good luck Ashish.
I want to start GCP and &#39;m planning to do associate cloud engineer certification within 2 months My question is that Is it possible to do certification in 2 months if I started now?
Hi, I have created a VM instance with default options, later stopped the VM and clicked on edit and added the same start up script shown in the video under the custom metadata section. Saved the changes, started the VM. Tried launching it by clicking external IP. However getting error &lt;ip add&gt; refused to connect. My VPN and firewall are default. Can you please guide me where am i going wrong 😔
Hi Ranga, I&#39;ve taken your course on udemy and I&#39;ve gone through 50 lectures till now. I&#39;m beginner in cloud environment and finding it difficult to understand theories you have explained in the videos but I&#39;ve understood the practicals easily. Is it happening only with me?
Coming soon :)
Hi Ranga, is there any upcoming course on GCP professional cloud architect? Would love to see that.
You can find the Link to the complete course in the description. Good Luck.
Excellent Mr.Ranga, very nice explanation.Please add other topics as well for gcp associate engineer
Hi, when I enter my card details. They do make trx for 2 rupee. But still my billing account is suspended and I can&#39;t use any of my cards. I googled and found that they are nit allowing cards with 2 step auth. As most of indian cards are 2 step auth cards. I am not able to open the account. What should I do?
Excellent Ranga, very nice session..
Hi D-BOY, <br>Folders show a question mark if you haven&#39;t opened them before. <br>Let me know if you have any other questions. <br>Thanks, <br>Joe
why the folders look like question mark ?? why i am not able to edit that all
Hi Yonathan, <br>It&#39;s probably a hidden file. <br>Follow the steps in the tutorial below to show hidden files in FileZilla:<br><a href="https://www.123-reg.co.uk/support/answers/accessing-hidden-files-via-ftp-filezilla-4162/">https://www.123-reg.co.uk/support/answers/accessing-hidden-files-via-ftp-filezilla-4162/</a><br>Let me know if you have any other questions!<br>Joe
Heyyy!! Help me please. I don&#39; t find the document htaccess
Hi Isabel,<br /><br />I can&#39;t thank you enough for u. It&#39;s very useful for me.
Isabel, this video and your comments totally walked me through it. I had changed a wordpress .php file in wp and lost complete access to my domain. Used the tutorial to replace the original file. Awesome, up and running again!!
You are my princess Isabel. THX
Hi Isabel,<br /><br />Thank you for this so much! But I am having a small problem with finding the link. I couldn&#39;t locate my root folder&#39;s link
Hi Isabel, <br />Very useful guide from you - as always! +1<br />Thanks so much for posting this... I am going to pin it to the top of the comments, as I feel that many users will find this guide very useful!<br />Best regards, <br />Joe
Glad it helped you L U O N G S O N ;-)
Brilliant stuff again Joe... so say you want to edit a file but get &quot;permission denied&quot; message... you have to do a root command:<br><br>1. locate the folder or file inside FTP you&#39;re wanting to edit<br>2. copy the link - example: /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/robots.txt<br>3. right-click file/folder and right down the permission (folders: 7xx Files:6xx...)<br>4. go to your shell command prompt tool through your domain SSH and type root command <br><br>sudo -i<br><br>5. change permissions to example: 777 (for folders) 666 (for files)... <br>chmod -R 666 /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/robots.txt<br><br>6. FTP: DOWNLOAD/BACKUP A COPY OF &#39;OLD&#39; FOLDER/FILE ...do the necessary editing and save the new folder/file... Test to see everything is in working condition just like you want it ;-) <br><br>7. CHANGE BACK: Don&#39;t forget to change permissions back to what it was previously... example: chmod -R 664 /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/robots.txt
Hi Isaac,<br>I am glad you found the tutorial helpful!<br>Thanks, <br>Joe

Hi Eduardo, <br>Thanks for pointing this out!<br>I didn&#39;t test this tutorial on Mac, just Windows.<br>Were you able to get it to work on Mac?
Hi Manoj, <br>Check out this tutorial - you can generate a key pair directly in the terminal. <br><a href="https://www.siteground.com/kb/how_to_generate_an_ssh_key_pair_in_mac_os/">https://www.siteground.com/kb/how_to_generate_an_ssh_key_pair_in_mac_os/</a>

Hi Marcelo, <br><br>I know exactly the frustration you&#39;re speaking of, it seems to be one of the drawbacks to using FTP over the command-line-interface. I don&#39;t know if there is a way to change permissions once-and-for-all without compromising your website&#39;s security. <br><br>And I am not familiar with the robots.txt error. Are you getting crawl errors?<br>Check out step 7 from this tutorial in which I configured an HTTP to HTTPS redirect:<br><a href="https://www.onepagezen.com/ssl-certificate-setup-wordpress-google-cloud-click-deploy/">https://www.onepagezen.com/ssl-certificate-setup-wordpress-google-cloud-click-deploy/</a><br><br>Let me know if this helps, <br>Joe
DONE! Very useful indeed... <br>There is a way make a ROOT (or sudo) connection via SFTP? Or Change privileges once for all. I&#39;m using Google Deploy and always have to change chmod to 755 or 777 to change something.<br><br>lastime, was the robots.txt.<br><br>Another thing. I did the HTTPs tutorial, and at my Google WebMaster console apear some problem with HTTP (without S) connection related to robots.txt.<br><br>To solve it, I have to deactivate the HTTP access in google console?
Hi Marcelo, <br>Unfortunately I don&#39;t have any experience with Dreamweaver, otherwise I would try to help!<br>I hope you&#39;re able to get it working.<br>Best, <br>Joe
trying to do the same using Dreamweaver and it&#39;s not working at all... =S
Sounds good!
I tried the same process using SFTP trough DreamWeaver CC and failed... Looking for a solution. When I find it I post here! =P
amazing....
Hi Dian, <br><br>If you&#39;re using Click-to-Deploy, WordPress files are located at: <br>/var/www/html<br><br>If you&#39;re using Bitnami, WordPress files are located at:<br> /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs<br><br>Let me know if you have any other questions! :)<br>Joe
its work, thanks sir
i already install wordpress in gcp; success connect sftp; but where my wordpress file sir?

No problem! :)
Thanks, Joe!
AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME
Hi Dev, <br><br>A lot of people have issues with establishing SSH tunnels. <br><br>Bitnami did a decent video on the process that you can watch here:<br><a href="https://docs.bitnami.com/google/apps/wordpress/#accessing-phpmyadmin-on-windows">https://docs.bitnami.com/google/apps/wordpress/#accessing-phpmyadmin-on-windows</a><br><br>Hope this helps. Feel free to let me know if you have questions. :)<br>Joe
I&#39;m unable to access my PhpMyAdmin even after establishing tunnel it gets redirected to sites name and gives the same error message. Is this because of the renaming code you add in the config file?
Thank. You save my life.

I was able to access folders but unable to edit them. Cannot edit delete files.
No problem! :D
Excellent. Thanks.
Hi Daisy, <br>You would have created a login credentials the first time you opened the Google Cloud shell. If you&#39;re having issues logging in, you should create a new SSH key pair and assign in to your instance (like I do in the following tutorial: <a href="https://www.onepagezen.com/phpmyadmin-ssh-tunnel/)">https://www.onepagezen.com/phpmyadmin-ssh-tunnel/)</a><br>Let me know if you have any questions! :)<br>Joe

Thank You soo much
Thank you very much

Hi Lukas, <br>This is not a problem that I have encountered before. Try pasting in &quot;command open rsa connection refused&quot; into Google and see what you find.<br>Also, is this your log in FileZilla or in your SSH terminal? <br>Talk to you soon, <br>Joe

Thanks for the feedback, Pavon. I&#39;m glad to hear the tutorial was helpful to you!
Great tutorial thanks. I was trying to find out how to SFTP files to my Google Cloud instance. I appreciate this.
Hello Ralph, <br />You can use ftp instead of sftp.<br />Just enter ftp:// instead of sftp:// as the prefix in the &#39;host&#39; field.<br />Please let me know if you have any other questions, :)<br />Joe
only sftp? can&#39;t use ftp to connect?
What error message are you getting?
why won&#39;t this work for me???????
It was in the same situation, i even wanted to give up. But thank God , google propose me your video. Big Thanks * infinity
Bro exact feeling here ... I too was going to quit up ... and lay low on same goDaddy! He saved me.
Thanks for the feedback William - I am glad the tutorial helped you! :D
I&#39;d just like to say a big THANK YOU! You really helped, already tried tons of things and only your tutorial worked. Was almost giving up using GCloud. Thanks!!
Glad to hear it! :)
working, thank you
excelente. me funciono, gracias, felicitaciones
Thanks Bruno! :)
One day I will be like you man! Thank you!
Awesome! I&#39;m glad the video helped you! :)
Yep to bad I was getting permission errors but fixed those as well by switching to a Minecraft specific hosting provider
Great - glad you were able to get the issue resolved! :)
Thank you you saved me about 5 hours of messing around and about another weeks work tried pretty much everything and got nothing but then found this video and worked like a charm.
Hi Debbie, <br />Putty Key Generator is a separate application. It is included in the PuTTY download package and is installed automatically to your computer when you download PuTTY. Hope this helps!<br />Joe
Super ! One question, did the download to this Putty, but it wants a setup procedure and I am unfamiliar of how to setup putty to become a key generator. Any videos on that?
very good !!!!
Thanks for the feedback Tom,<br />You can just as easily connect via FTP if you&#39;re inclined to do so (host name ftp:// instead of sftp://).
There would be a few more steps involved with FTP I believe, like opening firewall ports and actually setting up an FTP server and users (depending on the OS of course) - ironically I&#39;m trying to do this at the moment though over FTPS and I&#39;m running into a lot of issues! Hence how I stumbled upon your video
You should change your title to indicate this is SFTP and not FTP - there is a difference! I know SFTP i preferred, but for instances where people are constrained by other things, they might be wondering how to actually connect via FTP
Perfect my friend. Thank you very much for your contribution. This knowledge was very helpful to me. Congratulations and thank you for sharing.
Hi Ahmad, <br />This is a common issue and unfortunately there isn&#39;t a single solution for fixing the problem.<br />Check out these resources for additional information on fixing the issue:<br /><a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/204400/ssh-public-key-no-supported-authentication-methods-available-server-sent-publ">https://askubuntu.com/questions/204400/ssh-public-key-no-supported-authentication-methods-available-server-sent-publ</a><br /><a href="https://superuser.com/questions/852066/no-supported-authentication-methods-available-in-filezilla">https://superuser.com/questions/852066/no-supported-authentication-methods-available-in-filezilla</a><br />Let me know if you&#39;re able to get the issue resolved and what the problem was. <br />Thanks in advance, <br />Joe
Hi,<br /><br />i already followed all the steps... but when i try to connect, Filezilla give this msg.. <br />Error: Disconnected: No supported authentication methods available (server sent: publickey)
Perfect!!!! Thank you so much!

Thanks Dooun - I&#39;m glad to hear it helped you!
very nice tutorial, it helps me a lot !
As many people have stated already THANK YOU! Spent an hour looking at other solutions and yours was the only video that actually produced results. However, there&#39;s one issue that I hit and I wonder if you know off the top of your head. I was able to connect via Filezilla, but the rsa-key folder doesn&#39;t have my website files. The website is up so I know they are somewhere, but I can&#39;t find them anywhere with your solution. Ideas?
yes you are correct bro its sftp. and joe you are simply awesome i guess u helped many people with ur videos and all
Actually, it is not FTP, it is SFTP/SSH what you are using.
for some reason I am getting error 3 server permission denied when trying to edit or download files from my server. I thinking it wants sudo access, but not sure how to grant it to my whole Wordpress installation.
Hi Formador, <br />You can host as many sites as you want on a single VM. Check out WordPress multisite on Google Cloud (<a href="https://docs.bitnami.com/google/apps/wordpress-multisite/)">https://docs.bitnami.com/google/apps/wordpress-multisite/)</a>. <br />If you aren&#39;t using WordPress, you can configure multiple virtualhosts in your Apache configuration to serve directories from different domain names (<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/vhosts/name-based.html)">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/vhosts/name-based.html)</a>.
Great tutorial man.<br />Could you explain me if I can be able to host more than 1 web site in one VM? In this case, how could I do that? Thank you.
Hi Yusha, <br />I just recently checkout out <a href="http://cloudcmd.io/">cloudcmd.io</a>. It looks promising and I will look into doing a tutorial on the subject in the future!
Hello Joe! Can you please make a video on how to use cloud commander (cloudcmd.io) on a Google Compute Engine Instance?
Great &amp; Big helpful. Thanks

Hi Mahmoud, <br />Enter a &#39;key passphrase&#39; in both of the fields before saving the file. Then, when you try to connect, you will be prompted for the &#39;key passphrase&#39;.<br />Let me know if you have any questions, <br />Joe
how to add password? i have to add password,please help me
I have succefully connected by using the private key located at &#39;.ssh/google_compute_engine.ppk&#39; on local PC which was generated during initilizing Google Cloud SDK. The user name for FileZilla is the same as your user name on your google cloud instance.
i recieve the error <br />Disconnected: No supported authentication methods available (server sent: publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic)<br />also it said that it couldnt find the key i pasted in metadata
ask to bro Pm me
Tnx that was very helpfull, but now l have a permession problem, cuz l only get the access as a user not as the root, idk how to make the permission escalation thing happen
<a href="https://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/ssh-keys">https://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/ssh-keys</a> - For MAC install WINE app then generate RSA KEY with PuTTy Key Generator

Thank you, for these wonderful tutorials.Really appreciate your help. i have a question, is there a way to replace a file whose permission is 644 without changing its permission?

@Đại Lê after all the trouble it might be worth it. I have duplicated a slow site I had on hostgator web hosting, and now on GCP it goes so much faster. I am paying $12 more a month for GCP but I&#39;m still in the first year so I have time to decide on that.<br />I have made a blogpost that may help you <a href="http://phonetecho.blogspot.com/">phonetecho.blogspot.com</a>
I think their target users are not a fresher system (like me). I only want to set up my website on GCP but lot of trouble :(
@beny4300 around $144/year. I think you can find some other solutions. With $144/year, using hostinger, you can buy a cloud server to set up more than 5 websites and have 1 domain as a gift from hostinger. (sorry for my bad English)
Why google cloud or AWS be as simple as godaddy or hostgator? Why isnt there a simple straight forward way to use cpanel?
Yes - you can.
Can i upload plugins on the cloud?
Yes - it takes some practice!
I am new to GCP and fresh in using the command line, really hard to config it.
Thanks a ton man! Really helped me.
You will have to first click the ‘Edit’ button at the top of the page in order to view and edit the Metadata.
I&#39;m trying to follow the video. but I do not see the same options menu.Compute Engine-&gt; Metadata. Do you have to subscribe to any means of payment to see that menu?
Thank you Z-index!
Just One Line. &quot;Big Thank You&quot;
And how I do the same but with &quot;root&quot; user
My pleasure Kamaal!
Thank you so much
thank you!
Thank you !
Thanks Lukasz!
Don&#39;t get me wrong, but i love you man.
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/<a href="http://encikwira.tk/">encikwira.tk</a><br />service apache2 restart
still denied
sudo chmod -R 777 /var/www/html/<a href="http://encikwira.tk/">encikwira.tk
 </a><br />service apache2 restart<br /><br />all fixed. but 777 very open to the world???
Hi Ardy - not open to the world, just open to all users on your system. That being said, it&#39;s best to use the lowest level of permissions required to accomplish your objective.
thnak you very much. connected to my GCP server, but i cannot add my website content! permission denied
you saved me a lot of time. Thank you!
Thanks for your feedback. I know FileZilla has a bad reputation for some of their business practices - specifically bundling software from questionable sources in with their installer: <br /><a href="https://forum.filezilla-project.org/viewtopic.php?t=48441">https://forum.filezilla-project.org/viewtopic.php?t=48441</a>
STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY. WORST CUSTOMER SUPPORT EVER. Purchased File Zill Pro 6 months ago.<br />Upgrades not working, registration fails, not responsive, spaming my mailbox with automated messages.<br />Worst of all - they ask me to upgrade, while even download link is not working. Those people are the worst software people I&#39;ve been dealing with in my 40 years of IT work.<br />Although program itself is not terribly bad, people behind it as just a nightmare :-(
Very good video. But if only you had told the location of our main files (location of WP-config etc under google cloud file structure) it&#39;d been very great.
OMG THANK YOU!! i love you, i lost 3 hours trying to connect my ftp client, and i made it in 5 minutes thanks to you
Two things I would add: <br />1. Mac users already have ssh-keygen to create keys in terminal and need to add `-C keynamehere` when creating it to get the username.<br />2. WordPress installation is at `var/www/html/`
Someone can get me my bugo, someone has a vps to get me that is not using?

Thanks for the positive feedback Bill!
Super helpful! Thank you sir.
But how can we login as admin to our instance? I need to change permission to app.yml file thru Filezilla. When I do that, it says current user doen&#39;t have permission to do that.
Works flawlessly!
Double like for your video. For someone who installed wordpress bitnami, the path will be /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs.
You save me a lot of time. Thank you.
Thnks
thank you!
Bro, who can i contact you by email or something i need to clarify something referent to google cloud, who can i want to change hosting (all that implies) you know, mail accounts, wordpress hosting etc. and alsoneed a kind of estorage where our Voip platform provider will send us some CDRs so that we have them archived and for that they ask for an address SFTP, FTP etc ... and the truth is that I do not know what solution to give them and know more or less a decent cost, because they want to migrate to the cloud, be it GC, AWS, AZURE. if you answer me I would be grateful.
Thank you so much! Perfect tutorial!
Gracias!

Thank you for this great tutorial. I saved a lot of time.
I was able to successfully create an ssh key. But how do I find my username and password instead?

Could you explain this in more detail, please? I have this problem of not being able to edit the files.
Sorry, I installed it all but it reported an error :Error: Authentication failed.
 <br />Error: Critical error: Could not connect to server
Sorry, I installed it all but it reported an error :Error: Authentication failed.
 <br />Error: Critical error: Could not connect to server
@VIETSOF TECH That essentially means that either the host name, or the ip address for the database is wrong. Check all your login info and make sure the SSH keys are on your computer and assigned properly through google cloud.
This is a great video! It has helped me so much. I want to add something for people who might have experienced an error where their permissions were denied. All you have to to is connect to the computer either using putty or the chrome console, and type this: sudo chmod 777 -R (directory that you want to edit). This will open the permissions up for filezilla to use. <br /><br /><br />Command breakdown<br />sudo - Makes sure the command is ran as an admin<br />chmod - Allows you to edit file permissions<br />777 - Allows full read/write/run privileges <br />-R - Makes it recursive to all directories so that you dont have to do this for every file inside the directory

You didn&#39;t show us where in all them directories the home directory is for the website? You stop short on your video&#39;s every time. You do make good videos and I&#39;m making slow progress but one video just leads to the next. Craziness. Setting up Google Cloud is so difficult for people just starting out.<br /><br /><br />You forgot to tell us that you DON&#39;T HAVE WRITE PERMISSIONS.<br /><br />To enable write permissions go to SSH in VM Instances, once you&#39;re inside SSH you type in the following.<br /><br /><br />sudo chmod 777 /var/www/html and it&#39;ll enable write permissions. When you&#39;re done with what you need to do change it back to 755
Hi Victor, did you check /var/www/ folder?
Do you still remember the name of your folder? if so, you can use the &quot;Find&quot; function
@Alde Sabido not yet.
@Alde Sabido I did not do that yet. I&#39;m not sure how to do it.
@Alde Sabido hmm ok. Let me check.
Helpful video! Thank you! <br />Do you happen to know the name of the file where the html documents are stored?<br />I just can&#39;t find my simple html files after upload in Filezilla.
I can&#39;t import .jar files. Can you help me?
Logan Sim that’s true. Have to move cursor for randomness in keyfile.
&quot;So i&#39;m gonna click &#39;Generate&#39; and I&#39;m gonna move my cursor around in this gray area. This will generate the key file....&quot; LOL
Thanks Ferhat!

hello - thank you for tuts. in my google cloud dns i m getting error failed to load. not able to get anything on google too. help appreciated
check to see if you used url forwarding, disable it and use the method he gave (configure nameservers).
Have u got it fix ?
Same problem here. Did anyone find a solution ? I do not have any url forwarding
I have followed your method. But when I visit my site through my domain name, only the ip address shows on the browser but not the domain name.
is this work ?
clear and concise, got mine working with freenom ! thank you .
i want to register domain . com with google cloud not use free nom

Thanks alot.
Did you find a solution ? I have the same problem

Thank you Codedamn, working perfectly :) - Setting Up Custom Domain With Google Cloud Compute Engine Instance

Thank you man, works like a charm
thank you, it work
Hi,<br />i have my website hosted in hostgator and domain is in GoDaddy. Now i have to shift hosting to GCP. I have followed the tutorial to change and update name servers but its still pointing to older server as i checked the ip, it is being served on the last server only. can you please help how i can i be sure that my hosting is updated?<br /><br />Please reply asap.
Thank you.
Thanks a lot!
Worked great! Thank you!
it&#39;s showing refused to connect, i have set the servers too
thanks very good
How does this work for App Engine
thank for your video
Have it got fixed ?
Try to clear your DNS cache. For testing, you can try opening it from another device.
@codedamn hi, I have the same problem even though I cleared my cache and tried on several devices, can you help me with that please ?
When I go to my website it doesn&#39;t show my domain name, it shows the ip address on the browser instead. I&#39; m using GoDaddy.
Thanks, it works.
Just watched this. It works! Thanks.
That probably means your nameservers are not configured correctly with your domain registrar and it doesn&#39;t point at your IP address. If however you have configured it correctly, give it some time and the DNS cache would expire, try again later
Well the error actually changed now it says this. ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS. I cleared the cache like it says but nothing happened.
@Victoria Fife Well that simply means that your domain is redirecting to itself. That thing, I believe is mostly related to your server configuration (apache/nginx) or with your backend code. What&#39;s your website URL anyway?
It works now thank you for the help!
Mine tells me server IP address could not be found.What should I do to fix that?
thanks man
Thanks
its in compute engine, not app engine
I dont see any instances in App Engine? Can you help?
It works! Thanks Much! But, Can I repeat the process and add a Second external domain to the same GCP server public IP address?
Awesome!!! Thank you you saved life!!
Thank you so much. Struggled a lot following the documentation.
This is my life saver...... I am not a network guru in terms of doing hotspot for access points but this lead me to my solution and now my guest portal is working as it should be. Thank you.
What about how to add a second domain, when you generate a second or third domain, it gives new nameservers, such as 1st = A, 2nd = B, 3rd = C etc etc.<br /><br />So when you goto cpanel and try and add these addon domains, it says nameserver problem.<br />BUT if you change the scond name server ns-cloud-b2 to say ns-cloud-a1 to match the main instance for all 4...<br /><br />Google says:<br />Warning: Your NS records do not match the nameservers for your zone. This is not common and could cause problems.<br /><br />AND still in cpanel it says nameservers don&#39;t match.<br /><br />It seems impossible to use addon domains with Gcloud?<br /><br />Spent 3 days on it watched dozens of videos and hundreds of websites, not one will explain how to successfully add addon domains using only one VM instance + Cpanel.
Worked :)<br />Tons of Thanks (July 2019)
thank you codedamn, guys how long did it take to propogate?

You must wait the DNS change. From few hours to day.
How to undo this yea? I want to change the URL domain, so I delete the cloud DNS zones. When I try accessing my website via the IP address, it still redirects it to the old domain.
Thanks, It works in May 2020

I have looked and I&#39;m having difficulty finding a reliable process to evaluate large volume PDFs, medical records sent from other providers or that patients bring in themselves. The need for a backward database creation would allow for efficiency of time utilization. Time IS Money, but getting a more complete picture of previous diagnosis and treatment is literally affecting the new providers outcomes.

that could lead to security risk, someone who does not know anything about programing could easily erase all you have done, for example your child or a familiar is playing with your device with google account open; they could easily just play around with so sensitive data, that&#39;s why I guess google does not offer a erase button or a fancy UI to do that; and taking in mind that it&#39;s pretty unlikely that they know enough in programing to damage your app, you are saved. It&#39;s better in that way for your security

How it possible .I fun this video .this is amazing
I&#39;m shocked after watching this video...what a tour it is just amazing 😊😊
Google: We steal each and everyone&#39;s personal data then sell it to the web
My 15 accounts are stored there omg
Compared with Microsoft&#39;s underwater data center technology, there is obviously some waste here.
We are watching this video maybe coming from this data server.
THE GUARD COULD HAVE SAID A FEW WORDS, HE LOOKS NICE (looks like Kenny McCormick, SOUTH PARK)

there is one man that is just in random spots and it is weird
Hi surprise 🙂
@howltae Ackerman LOL
I am surprise How to edit this video
use premiere pro and tick 360 option at render
How to edit🙄🙄🙄
When you realize that this video is probably stored here too
How

hi google. can you build data center in my country Malaysia. Terima Kasih

I am looking for answer. When I try to upload the project, on the video show the bottom &quot;existing project&quot;, but in my maya I cannot make it available. How can I fix it ?
Thank you Google
Hi there. This setup include particles, legacy or nParticles for maya? the script takes all the prj data, including the cache files? What is the limit of data...I have some 2x TB...it is possible?
I tried it but zync only returns to me either black or white screen Tif files that weigh between 20-30 KB’s 😭. Can someone please help me?
My job only says &quot;DONE&quot; when is uploades but isn´t render any render
This is a perfect use case for cloud computing. This used to be called “batch” processing – scheduling super expensive compute resources where the output would eventually come back to the user completed – in a day, a week, who knows. God forbid the user had a parameter, a comma, out of place that made the job abort… Doh! Then the next day they would get a crack at running a corrected job.<br /><br />Now it’s literally done in real-time with hundreds of virtual machines that spin up on-demand and chew through the task while the expensive, hard to find, and hard to keep human resource is getting ready for their next step. Concentration is maintained and output is maximized without breaking the bank with a major capital investment that used to take the board of directors to sign off on.<br /><br />I LOVE it!
Hey Laura, It is on the top right hand side corner. Hope this helps!
Where is the console,I can&#39;t see any console here.
I&#39;ll release a video on this topic tomorrow, but with the average web page size being 1.4 MB, 8K page hits would be around 11 GB of traffic, so you&#39;d pay around $1.25 for this traffic. Big estimate, but tomorrow&#39;s video should clear things up
@Tony Teaches Tech thanks, waiting for the video
So in general if my website start getting traffic between 250 visits per day or around 8K per month, then do you think It will still be under free tier ? <br />(A Blogging Website on Astra theme of 50 blog posts, total website data size under 150Mb)
Yea definitely... <a href="https://youtu.be/P7W4iYkFaOU">https://youtu.be/P7W4iYkFaOU</a>
Great Video, thanks Tony. I assume we can host multiple WP sites .. right?
Coming up in the next few days, stay tuned!
SSL installation within this video would make this a perfect video
Free forever... or at least until Google says it isn&#39;t free anymore ;)
This is free for how long, 1 month or lifetime.
Good job so far! Actually I don&#39;t back up my WordPress sites (I know, I know not a good idea). Let me look into a making a video on this topic!
This SSH command system is new to me. But learning is fun. We installed WordPress from SSH. But how do we back up our website? How to download it. And also tell us how to run the website by uploading any existing website data.
@Tony Teaches Tech Hi , teacher Tony , can i ask you , if I am in Aisa , can i choose the us-west1 ?? What will happen ?? thx ~~
@金克 Yes of course you can choose the us-west1 server. This just means that your website will exist on a server that&#39;s located in the western United States, that&#39;s all.
No, only the following regions are eligible for the free tier:<br />Oregon: us-west1<br />Iowa: us-central1<br />South Carolina: us-east1
im from south east asia, im choosing the singapore region. i assume i wont get to use it for free?
found it, it&#39;s on create/ edit page:)
Glad you found it :)
@Jake Wisemen you go to the cm instance, click on it, then, at the top of the page click edit.. scroll down to ask keys and click <a href="http://add.you/">add.you</a> can paste the key there. The key you can generate from putty (on windows). Download putty, then there&#39;s an exe like puttygen.exe start it, add your email in the comments section, click generate, copy the text from the text box at the top into the Google console, and save the private key to your pc...tony needs a video about this:)
Where can I find / add /download a SSH key?
Yes, definitely
@Tony Teaches Tech Thanks Tony! you are the master!
can use LOMP in this VM Google Cloud?
@Tony Teaches Tech I have the same problem and I don&#39;t know much coding to rectify it. Could you give me a direction to how I can fix this? Thanks
I had the same problem, I just delete the &quot;default&quot; file in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled and restart the web server with &quot;sudo systemctl restart nginx&quot; and the problem disappeared like magic hehe
replace line 6 on the conf file with server_name &lt;your.ip.address&gt;;<br />test nginx with &quot;sudo nginx -t&quot;<br />restart nginx with &quot;sudo systemctl restart nginx&quot;
@Tony Teaches Tech Hi Tony. Thanks so much for this video. I have attempted to do this 20+ times and I also get the default Nginx page. Any insight would be very much appreciated.<br />Best, C.
Seems like Nginx is still serving the default index.html page at /var/www/html. Are you sure you installed WordPress in that directory? Maybe you have both an index.html and index.php file in that directory. I would look at that first.
Okay I’ll try again... thanks for the answer, Tony..
@Rahul Rajeev Are you sure that you restarted the nginx server to apply your configuration changes?<br />sudo systemctl restart nginx<br />It&#39;s possible if you skipped this step, nginx will still be serving the default Nginx page. Please let me know if that works for you!
Hi Tony, thanks for the video!<br /><br />I’ve a question for you.. I’ve followed ur instructions step by step. But when I open my website, i just read a message like this “welcome to nginx! .....”<br /><br />Could you please help me to fix this problem?<br /><br /><br />Thanks in advance
Hi there. I&#39;ll do my best to answer your questions.<br />1) &quot;Google Cloud Free Tier is also available for external IP addresses that are being used by VM instances. In-use external IP addresses are available without additional cost until you have used a number of hours equal to the total hours in the current month. Usage calculations are combined across all in-use external IP addresses across all regions. Google Cloud Free Tier for in-use external IP addresses applies to all non-preemptible instance types, not just f1-micro instances&quot; <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier">https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier</a><br />2) This video shows you how to send free email if you purchase your domain name with Google Domains <a href="https://youtu.be/RbT28X0wiRw">https://youtu.be/RbT28X0wiRw</a><br />3) I will look into Nginx caching<br />4) GCP has built-in detailed VM usage statistics in the dashboard, no need for additional monitors<br />5) Having a bit of disk space for swap is not a bad idea IMO
Hey Tony, I have few questions. <br /><br />1. Don&#39;t we need an external ip address for our website through google? Isn&#39;t it recommended or just an A record like you did on your domain registrar should be fine?<br />2. Do you have a video how to setup free email like contact@<a href="http://exampledomain.com/">exampledomain.com</a> which can send and receive free email?<br />3. Please make a video on setting up caching with nginx. <br />4. Also how to setup monitoring for the VM Disk Usage, Cpu Usage, and backup options using snapshot.<br />5. Please share also your opinion on using swap option and reserving some disk space to be used as ram just in case. <br /><br />Please note I am not a linux pro, I am just a newbie learning through tutorials and above are the few approaches I saw on various other videos which look useful but not could not get the hang of it. <br /><br />Thank you. I have seen so many videos on GCP Free Tier but Finally Glad to have found your video. :)
Did you change the INI file for the correct version of PHP that WordPress is using? Double check this
@Tony Teaches Tech I did but it wasnt working anyways I restarted my VM and somehow it magically worked... Thanks for your reply. Keep up Regular viewer of your channel... If you get a chance have a look at below link and make a video that. <br /><br />It shows how they implement fast cgi and redis have a look at the picture diagram and see if you can make it work for all of us :P
@Waqas Zafar Happy to hear you go it working. Thank you for watching my videos :)<br />I didn&#39;t see a link... try again?
Hi, Tony, I followed your tutorial and was able to set it up. However, I am not able to change the Max File Upload size on my wordpress site. I Followed your other tutorial but still it did not change any suggestion?
Maybe, but I&#39;m not aware of how to do this
Is there a way to limit the bandwidth? Like couldn&#39;t I got to site and keep refreshing to drive up someone&#39;s cost?
Commented a lot of Youtuberas but got no reply from them
Hi there. You shouldn&#39;t necessarily update PHP, but rather install a new version alongside the system version. I&#39;m assuming your using Nginx because you commented on this video...<br /><br />sudo apt update<br />sudo apt install php7.4 php7.4-fpm<br /><br />Next, edit your Nginx config file to reflect the new PHP version<br /><br />systemctl reload nginx<br /><br />That should do it.
hey tony<br />i&#39;m using google cloud platform, I looked at Tutorials and started the website, but now PHP update massage is coming. How to update this.<br />I don&#39;t know cpanel, and mysql<br /><br />I saw tutorials and started a website, now there is traffic as well as revenue<br /><br />How to update php now
press &quot;esc&quot;<br />then type &quot;:wq&quot;
I see it :wq :))))
Yep, :wp
im stuck here too. press esc on vim doesnt do anything. where do i type :wq? thanks!
Hi Tony, thank you for making this video. Just one thing I need help with, can you explain how to &#39;save that file&#39;, as mentioned at 12.14. Not sure how to save and get back to the command line to continue the process.
That&#39;s a good idea for a future video!<br />This error is typically because of a syntax error in your configuration file. Try to execute the following command to get some more information about the source of the error:<br />sudo nginx -t
Hi Tony, I have enjoyed learning by using your video. I went through every step, and everything goes just right. As on your screen, until the very last moment when i restart nginx i get this...i went from start to end 3 times and the same error/fail at the last step.<br />Job for nginx.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
 <br />the error being <br /> Active: failed (Result: exit-code) <br />systemd[1]: nginx.service: Failed with result &#39;exit-code&#39;.<br />systemd[1]: Failed to start A high performance web server and a reverse proxy server.<br /><br />Could you maybe do a common errors and how to fix them video? Cheers :)
There is not limit to bandwidth usage on GCP because you pay per GB <a href="https://youtu.be/rrWIovnaf58">https://youtu.be/rrWIovnaf58</a>
@Tony Teaches Tech hope you didn&#39;t get my point.<br />I asked this doubt on free server.
@Pulambal Aasami I don&#39;t understand
What about total internet usage limit ?<br />Eg: Digital Cloud openly says 1TB per month for $5/m droplet<br />Why not google cloud openly says about this to the common people.<br />That&#39;s why we doubt google cloud to use.<br />For $5/m system: 1 CPU, 1Gb RAM, 25 GB SSD and where is the internet band width usage limit ?<br />I spent several hours to search it and not found any where openly.<br />May be this is the catch to raise our billing at the end.
This video which compares Nginx, Apache, and OpenLiteSpeed should give you some insight <a href="https://youtu.be/BAMkvEvpol0">https://youtu.be/BAMkvEvpol0</a>
Thanks for this video Tony!<br /><br />On question: Given exactly the same website installed as you show here and another one in OpenLiteSpeed which one would run faster? Or put it in a different way: Would you prefer LiteSpeed over Nginx? Thanks again!
Can you please copy the error message that you get and provide context as to when you get this error? I don&#39;t see any relevant information on &quot;code e163&quot; when I researched it online.<br />Also, why do you say the Mariadb instructions are glitched?
Hi Tony, hopefully you can help<br /> I keep getting the code e163 there is only one file to edit when adding the nginx configuration in vim text editor. Tried fixing several times and even deleted and restarted whole instance 3 times still same issue. Had to use different Mariadb instructions from the ones provided because they glitched. Please please help. Feel like I&#39;m going crazy. Not a professional coder. Just need to create site from scratch.
What do you mean?
@Tony Teaches Tech i mean if you started the cloud server then it cost 1500 dollar per month
so its not free at all
@mingjie zhu The server is free according to the GCP Free Tier specifications <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free">https://cloud.google.com/free</a>
@Tony Teaches Tech my bad I have use the vm
dude its cost
You could definitely do this. The latency would exist, but would not be noticable from the perspective of your users
If i was in the UK could i set up a vm in the US to host a website targeted for uk? Or would it increase the latency
Yea im having issue to it says sudo: vim: command not found
Yeah that seems like potentially a syntax error in your config file
@Tony Teaches Tech dumb question i&#39;m sure but when you have localhost in step 7, that should be the domain you&#39;re setting up correct? such as <a href="http://gideon.com/">gideon.com</a> or just gideon since that&#39;s the name of the instance i&#39;m creating?
@Evan Baker This should indeed be localhost because your database is on the same server as your website
this is a great tutorial and Im trying to follow it step by step, but running in to issues towards the end after the .conf configuration section and can&#39;t restart nginx getting authentication failed error obviously I&#39;m missing a step or doing something wrong.
You can easily put your html code in the root of the web directory to display your website
Thank you for the great video! Does this give the ability to embed html code to build the entire website?
Assuming you already have bought your domain from Google Domains, you&#39;d simply go into the DNS settings for this domain (in Google Domains) and add an A record with the value of the IP address of your VM. That&#39;s it!
Great video, need to ask how to connect this new VM instance to Google Domains? Thanks in advance.
Hi Mark, thank you for your kind words.<br />I have this blog post which is specific to Apache (not Nginx) <a href="https://tonyteaches.tech/wordpress-max-upload-size/">https://tonyteaches.tech/wordpress-max-upload-size/</a><br />For Nginx, this file might be at /etc/php/7.X/fpm/php.ini for you. Remember to restart the web server with systemctl nginx restart
Hi Tony, absolutely loved the video. I can clearly see you are vary talented, but myself, not so much. Can you help explain how to increase the max file size in nginx. My error message is &quot;413 request entity too large nginx/1.18.0 (ubuntu)&quot; from what i understand this, &quot;# set client body size to 200m&quot; &quot;# client_max_body_size 200m;&quot; needs to go in the nginx.conf. But i have no idea how to make this happen. We appreciate you good sir.
You bet Clyde
Great video, thanks Tony!
I personally use WPX for most of my websites now
@Tony Teaches Tech thank you, happy new year
Hey thank you, i wish i can do like you, for my abilities that&#39;s abit complicated and would take much time,<br />Any web hosting you recommend please, secure &amp; fast loading website
What are you referring to?
Too unfriendly and unwieldy
What&#39;s the error you get?
Tony Teaches Tech well for elementor none of the website/themes/templates would load. Like it wouldn’t even get me into the editor and says I should go in safe mode. Going in safe mode does nothing either.
Hey Tony, I followed your tutorial and for some reason I&#39;m not able to use plugins like Elementor on my server for some reason. By any chance you have a fix?
What email system?
The e-mail system becomes a problem with this method.
You get these free hour every month!
@Tony Teaches Tech perfect, thanks!
Hey Tony, are these 744 hours free only for the first month or every month, we get 744 hours?
Hit the Esc key then type :wp<br />Here&#39;s a quick video on how to use vim <a href="https://youtu.be/uE4aljoMBeg">https://youtu.be/uE4aljoMBeg</a>
@Tony Teaches Tech thank you so much
I have a question. I have been following the steps, but after the &quot;upstream example-php-handler&quot;, what did you do to save it and go back? I&#39;m stuck there
Yes, absolutely! If you&#39;re looking for a free solution, Google Cloud is a great option. As your website grows, Google Cloud can get quite expensive so I would recommend something like Linode or DigitalOcean at that point.
@Tony Teaches Tech Your input is highly valued. Thank you for the response and direction. I appreciate it!
Hi Tony, is it possible to host my own designed website on Google Cloud? I learned HTML, CSS, PHP, and Java so I would like to build my website and then host it with Google Cloud.<br />Thanks for your efforts in keeping us all informed!
@Tony Teaches Tech when i do that it says no file name
In vim, you have to hit Esc then type :wq to save a file
Hi, this is a really dumb question but, how do you actually save de .conf file? I hit Crtl + S and Crtl + G but nothing happens. :(
that is google cloud for you. azure just works
Are you having trouble?
Tony -- WTF! I have spent the last 3 hours with this craziness.
Google Sites websites can only be hosted with Google Sites. They cannot be hosted elsewhere
Good video mate! Also, how do you do this for a web page made from Google sites?
Check out this playlist of mine to get started with WordPress <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_vyuxE-AO-D7iDYJQ1fduxMHKaaf-lca">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_vyuxE-AO-D7iDYJQ1fduxMHKaaf-lca</a>
@Tony Teaches Tech what I meant is if u install wp this way ftp won’t be setup
@Diy Mendes In that case, you still don&#39;t need FTP to install plugins or themes. From within the WordPress admin dashboard, you can go to Plugins &gt; Add New and Appearance &gt; Themes &gt; Add New to do this.
how to upload themes or install or even plugin...??????
I&#39;m not sure if this is a permissions issue, privilege issue, or syntax error.<br />Things you can try:<br />- sudo systemctl restart nginx<br />- sudo nginx -t
Thanks Tony for this tutorial. However, i am getting the following when trying to restart Nginx ie the last step. getting Failed to restart nginx.service: Access denied. Any idea?
You&#39;re very welcome, and thank you so much for taking the time to tell me :)
Of all the videos available, your one is the clearest and most useful. Thank you very much Tony and have a blessed life.
Great to hear!
Thanks for the video! Everything worked perfectly.
I appreciate that Matthew!
Why does this video only have 6k of views? Keep it up man. Best tutorial for getting started with Google Cloud!
In general, you&#39;ll find that most people will say that mariadb can be faster than mysql
Why use maria db vs mysql 5.7 or mysql 8.0?
Please! <br />I have the same problem <br />What should I do to fix it?
@Tony Teaches Tech I did the prefix sudo but the same error still <br />&quot;Job for nginx.service failed because the control process exited with error code.&quot;
Can you try prefixing your command with sudo?
@Ahmed Alkarany Please take a look at this video <a href="https://youtu.be/DSPUP5TZd9A">https://youtu.be/DSPUP5TZd9A</a> which will help you solve your Nginx error

Potentially yes since you have &quot;dedicated&quot; resources that you&#39;re not sharing with other sites
@Tony Teaches Tech thanks! Would this free cloud package be suitable to a small e-commerce site?
@Thomas N Yes I believe so
Is there a big improvement compared to Shared Hosting Tony?
Most welcome 😊
After 2 hours of hard working finally I made it. Thank you, sir
LOL I&#39;m sorry. I use vim all the time in my videos and forget to explain it. I think you figured it out by now, but for others, here&#39;s a basic vim tutorial <a href="https://youtu.be/uE4aljoMBeg">https://youtu.be/uE4aljoMBeg</a>
DUDE!<br />Please tell people HOW to save and get OUT of Vim! I thought it was like any other editor.<br />Nope!<br />It took me another 45 mins to finish the conf file! <br />I learned something, though.<br />Thanks, Tony!<br />Good video.
What is FTL?
what if i got some error of codes on my config or other file how could open my FTL?<br /> I mean may directory?
Add sudo before your command
Please try to add sudo to the beginning of your commands

Hey, when i try to execute &quot;create username @ localhost identified by example password&quot; i get error 1396 operation failed. Does anyone know why?
No it is two ampersands...<br />sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade
@Tony Teaches Tech thank you so much sir ❤
hi what&#39;s this character between <br /><br />sudo apt update 👉 &quot; 👈 sudo apt upgrade ?? is that right? is that a quotation mark? or not?<br /><br />thanks.
There will be no charge due to the 744 free hours
@Tony Teaches Tech AFTER 744 FREE hours what will be the charge sir.
@shreyash sharma There are only 744 hours in 1 month. You get approximately 744 hours for free each month.
but it will charge around 5.08 $ p/ month see your vid <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f56PG7QxjFI&amp;t=3m08s">3:08</a>, cause it is written &quot;your first 744 hours of f1-micro instance usage are &#39;free this month&#39;&quot;.
@Planet Jubilee same, did you figure this out?
I get the same thing. I think It&#39;s still using the default
Try the following:<br />sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default<br />sudo systemctl restart nginx<br /><br />Does that work?
@Tony Teaches Tech @Abraham Kayal This worked!! Thanks Tony
I went to my IP and it said &quot;welcome to nginx!&quot; instead of wordpress, thoughts?
The only difference is convenience. Doing it manually, you might get a more up-to-date version, but from the marketplace you can always upgrade the packages and eventually get to the same place.
What&#39;s the difference between creating an instance and install WP in SSH to install WP directly in the marketplace with Bitnami or Google solutions?
If you choose the options that I choose in the video based on the Free Tier, you will never have to pay. It&#39;s free every month.
Nice tutorial! So the first month for this particular set of requirements is free but what about the second one and so on? Will it be free until 300USD in credits are gone?
This would not be free with this type of setup, but you have options. If you bought your domain from Google Domains, you can do something like this <a href="https://youtu.be/RbT28X0wiRw">https://youtu.be/RbT28X0wiRw</a><br />Another option is to host your own email server <a href="https://youtu.be/8G93NVWkXZk">https://youtu.be/8G93NVWkXZk</a>
What about creating an email on your domain like (example@yourdomain.example) is it also free of charge ?
You&#39;re welcome!
Thanks for this! It Works!!
Sorry for not making that clear! I saved the file by typing the following...<br />Esc :wq Enter<br /><br />Here&#39;s a video that will help you with the Vim text editor <a href="https://youtu.be/uE4aljoMBeg">https://youtu.be/uE4aljoMBeg</a>
@Tony Teaches Tech thank you for your time and reply, i already find it in the comment and i did but still i have issue in the last part nginx error
hey bro thank you for this video, can i ask you what you did exactly in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f56PG7QxjFI&amp;t=12m14s">12:14</a>? did you press something?
If the tar file includes a copy of the database and your website files, in theory you could stand up the website by putting the files in a publicly accessible directory and executing the SQL file
@Tony Teaches Tech It was the file from the previous hosting provider. Hopefully it does. :)
What do you have to do to import an existing wordpress site, you&#39;ve already built(to a certain point) and you only have a .tar file of your site?
Hello Tony, <br /><br />Great Tutorial, I&#39;ve a problem, I created my domain with google, A and CNAME records was easy but at the end of my tutorial project &quot;<a href="http://informaticien.ca/">informaticien.ca</a>&quot;, when I access to my domain it redirect me to my external ip <a href="http://35.222.237.117/">35.222.237.117</a>.<br /><br />Can you help me, THanks.<br /><br /><br /><br />This is my cofig <b>*</b> on sites-available / sites-enabled<br /><br />upstream example-php-handler {<br /> server unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;<br /> <br />} <br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23wordpress">#WORDPRESS</a> - DOMAIN<br />server {<br /> listen 80; <br /> server_name <a href="http://informaticien.ca/">informaticien.ca</a>;<br /> # In my case my web show me a external ip <a href="http://35.222.237.117/">35.222.237.117</a>; <br /> root /var/www/wordpress;<br /> index index.php;<br /> location / { <br /> try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;<br /> } <br /> location ~ \.php$ {<br /> include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;<br /> fastcgi_pass example-php-handler; # See that this it the ref to upstream on the top of the doc.<br /> } <br />}

Hi is anybody can help me from the part upload upstream and how to save it? I cannot do it successfully:( thanks a lot
Great to hear!
thank you Tony a lot . I have been struggling a bit, but after 3 times try over again, I have made it successfully. You are the best &lt;3
Are there any error message that you see during the import?
@Tony Teaches Tech I have nginx and already updated 
 <br />
 <br />/etc/php/7.4/cli/php.ini
 <br />/etc/php/7.4/fpm/php.ini
 <br />
 <br />as you told for 1024M without any result, its still 2M
@4 Tech Can you verify that WordPress is using php 7.4 by going to Tools &gt; Site Health &gt; Info &gt; Server? You can also verify the max upload size here.
Thank you very much Tony for the detailed tutorial, but I have problems importing demo sites from the GeneratPress site library, the importing process reaches importing content and doesn&#39;t finish it. And connecting some plugins like google kit does the same problem trying to connect and Checking the Compatibility step. What do you think the problem is?
<a href="https://youtu.be/PLKIPcY_eMs">https://youtu.be/PLKIPcY_eMs</a> but please note this video is for Apache. You&#39;ll need to specify Nginx instead
Thanks, Tony, but where can I found the ( upload_max_filesize &amp;
  post_max_size ) because I can&#39;t found them in PHP.ini or Nginx.conf
It seems like others have run into this issue too. Try the following:<br />sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default<br />sudo systemctl restart nginx
@Tony Teaches Tech Did it. Now i get &quot;502 Bad Gateway&quot; i have to say that i go to my website with my extern id, but i think thats no difference or?
@Sven Hüning Please see this video for help with the 502 error <a href="https://youtu.be/hYVriHb43wU">https://youtu.be/hYVriHb43wU</a>

In your terminal window, do something like this:<br />sudo apt-get install php-curl php-dom php-imagick php-zip .... (please note, I&#39;m just guessing and haven&#39;t tested this out, but this should give you a good idea)
Hi im having this problem, please could you help?<br /><br />The WordPress Hosting Team maintains a list of those modules, both recommended and required, in the team handbook (opens in a new tab).

No problem 👍
Great video mate thank you
You&#39;re welcome!
I was beginning to doubt I could find a straightforward, step-by-step guide - until I found this. Excellent work! Thank you.
Yep
Is it working still?
You can use a plugin like Duplicator to migrate your site to another host in the future
hope if you want to change host in future from google it wont be a problem?
It&#39;s the machine in Google&#39;s data center that will be hosting his site
That&#39;s the operating systems that will host your website
Of all the 3 videos I watched you were by far the best, but wow, this is way too complicated for the regular user such as I; all i have is a small website for a non profit and right now I have it with GoDaddy. I have my pages within dreamweaver and it is easy to upload the files. Can anyone tell me, the Operating system under the boot disk, is it the operating system you are running on your computer, or their (google) operating system that will be hosting your page? Thanks
Does it say what the syntax error is or where it&#39;s located?
Hey I&#39;m stuck at create username password line. Says error in syntax
Sorry, I&#39;m not familiar with laragon
if used laragon will the database still work
Yes
If someone built me a word press website can I use this meathod to host for free?
#ERROR!
Try prefixing the command with sudo
@Tony Teaches Tech there was an error in my conf file, working fine now, thanks
Hi Tony<br /><br />I get to point 9 and then get an error when I try to restart nginx
Thanks for subbing!
Thank you so much !!! You are amazing! I subscribed right away!
Can you double check how many Nginx config files you have under /etc/nginx/sites-enabled? If you find additional configs, delete the extraneous ones and restart the server. Otherwise, please let me know if the problem persists.
There is the default file and the config file I added only, in both site-available and site-enabled folders. Does the name of the config file matter?
@Abraham Kayal no I didn&#39;t. Unfortunately it just doesn&#39;t take my config file for some reason. It&#39;s just taking the html folder (nginx page) for the homepage
For the record the following command from Tony resolved my issue<br /><br />sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default<br />sudo systemctl restart nginx
Hi Tony, your video tutorial is very clear and easy to follow. A reminder that your associated blog post missed sudo for nginx restart. I have a quick question though, as I don&#39;t have a domain name setup yet. Just testing this out. I did server_name _; as you noted, and was able to access using the external ip address, but it only led me to welcome to nginx page rather than WordPress. Is there something I likely missed? Thanks
That has never happened to me
Hi Tony, I&#39;ve successfully created my site following your instructions, but ran into site shutting down intermittently (sometimes in a day, sometimes after ~ 6 days), I found that I can&#39;t get access to the SSH from google Cloud when that happens. And I keep having to stop and restart the VM. I was wondering if it happens to you or others? Thanks
This is great, easy to understand, easy to follow. <br />But.
 <br />Even I followed exactly what you do I run into this problem:
 <br />xxxxxxx@xxxxxxxx:/etc/nginx/sites-available$ systemctl restart nginx
 <br />==== AUTHENTICATING FOR org.freedesktop.systemd1.manage-units ===
 <br />Authentication is required to restart &#39;nginx.service&#39;.
 <br />Authenticating as: Ubuntu (ubuntu)
 <br />Password: 
 <br />polkit-agent-helper-1: pam_authenticate failed: Authentication failure
 <br />
 <br />Why?
 <br />It is not the root password, nor the database password.
 <br />Until this step exaclty the same thing happened that in your video.
 <br />
 <br />Could anyone help me out? (I am absolutely not programmer on any level, so be nice with me)<br />// by the way, @Tony Florida​, your contact page does not sending messeges ..//
I knew sooner than later I would stumble apone something like this &amp; some !

my state bank of india debit card is not accept.whats can i do??
I&#39;ve spent my entire day trying to figure out how to get WP Store Locator Wordpress plugin working. It keeps saying that I need to &quot;enable billing&quot;, yet I see no option to do so. I do have billing enabled though since I have a credit card enabled. Not sure if that&#39;s all I need to do or not. Google&#39;s documentation and various pages and options are so damn confusing. Everything with Google is unnecessarily confusing. This should not be that difficult. Even accessing my API&#39;s is not intuitive. So frustrating.

Were you not using S3 Transfer Acceleration?
Thank u for this awesome video
haven&#39;t yet
@Ben Awad Nice challenge 😁
Hi Ben, did you ever implemented saving files to a google drive in node js for users who has to give permission? If you did, do you have any tips? What api did you use? Trying to figure it out.😃
so much thanks! this really help me
Whenever I code that sure
Can you show an example of a download from Storage using node js with express?
Thank you very much, work as a charm!
you get a $300 credit when you sign up
@Ben Awad every month or once?, And how much google charge per GB?
how much data, we can store for free?
Possibly
Isn&#39;t this method too much overhead on scale? I&#39;ve been using a signed URL approach and it removed pretty much all the overhead from our servers.
Do you know how to delete an image from google using their API?
Hi Ben, can you also teach how the graphql mutation to delete the image from google server.
<a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/cloudblog.withgoogle.com/products/storage-data-transfer/uploading-images-directly-to-cloud-storage-by-using-signed-url/amp/">https://www.google.com/amp/s/cloudblog.withgoogle.com/products/storage-data-transfer/uploading-images-directly-to-cloud-storage-by-using-signed-url/amp/</a>
wow that looks way more involved than S3&#39;s
S3 supports browser direct uploads. It would be nice to have a similar tutorial on google storage
I&#39;m not sure
@Ben Awad I have to provide the Path as a param among others in JSON format for third party app, how can I put the location of the bucket so that this third party can put the file on it (I can only provide the location where to put the file, I don&#39;t have control on this third party) Thanks.
Can I provide the bucket URL to put files in it thru nodejs ?
happy to help :)
just fuckin perfect god bless you :)
I&#39;m not sure, I haven&#39;t tried cloud functions
@Ben Awad thanks, I&#39;ll check it out.
Very nice video, liked a lot. Question: can I use google cloud storage client library in a google cloud function, or I want to know if it is incorrect?? Wich is the best way to do it?
Thanks man, you save my day!
google cloud credentials, you&#39;ll get them from google
@Ben Awad aa, thanks ! keep it uup
i still dont understand from where the apollo test json file came ??
cool, thanks
If you provide a path to a JSON file, the projectId is not necessary.
probably, but I haven&#39;t look into it much
Is there any risk for having images public for a site that needs to upload a lot of images - for example a bucket to hold thousands of product images.<br /><br />It doesn&#39;t matter if these images are public in this example (in the sense that it&#39;s ok if someone views them all), but if someone was to cycle through all the images constantly (possibly maliciously), your bill would essentially be unlimited. <br /><br />Is there some way to make images private, but accessible by the front end/your backend etc?
use signed urls to upload directly to cloud storage
Hey Ben I have a question, I have integrated cloud storage for upload and download but for upload what I&#39;m doing is I use multer with in memory storage, how do I optimise it for high loads because my server may run out of memory on spikes. File size can be atmost 100mb
can i upload mp3 file with it?
wait I need credit card info to create an account? wtf
This is probably not relevant for you anymore, but for any future readers when regenerating a new jwt token you must remove the iat and exp properties from the authenticated user details you&#39;re passing on to the jwt.sign.
Im getting this 500 error : invalid grant invalid jwt: Token must be a short-lived version (60 minutes) and in a reasonable timeframe. Check your iat and exp values in the JWT claim. Does anyone have any idea on how to solve this?
Thank you so much for this video! With your help I fixed a bug in my bucket access. Yeah!
&quot;.save&quot; is a nice way to go as well. I was going in circles with saving a &quot;pdf&quot; buffer <br />const theFile = gc.bucket(bucketName).file(&quot;tester.pdf&quot;);<br /> theFile.save(pdf, (err) =&gt; {<br /> if (!err) {<br /> console.log(&quot;cool&quot;);<br /> } else {<br /> console.log(&quot;error &quot; + err);<br /> }<br /> });<br /><a href="https://googleapis.dev/nodejs/storage/latest/File.html#save">https://googleapis.dev/nodejs/storage/latest/File.html#save</a>
There is one way that i can upload files from url? Example:<br />storage.bucket(firebaseConfig.storageBucket)<br /> .upload(&#39;<a href="https://www.my-site.com/myImage.jpg&#39;">https://www.my-site.com/myImage.jpg&#39;</a>, {<br /> gzip: true,<br /> metadata: {<br /> cacheControl: &#39;public, max-age=31536000&#39;,<br /> },<br /> });
i&#39;m sorry is an old question, but i find out is same key firebase create. you can check on here <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/">https://console.cloud.google.com/</a>
I would love to know what that json file looks like. Any idea anyone? I have a key but it seems I can&#39;t just pass it as a string.
thanks!!
it says cannot read property join of undefined in the keyFilename join
Just rewrite the code or request <a href="https://youtu.be/m3Sc7nVLPP8">https://youtu.be/m3Sc7nVLPP8</a>
Use an alternative with apps script, example <a href="https://youtu.be/m3Sc7nVLPP8">https://youtu.be/m3Sc7nVLPP8</a>
Great video! I have the exact same setup, and everything works, except the uploaded image is broken when I view it in the google console. Do you have any ideas on why? :(
Plot Twist: He only made the video to show the front-end framework tierlist on his desktop (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGSzMfKBV9Q&amp;t=8m28s">8:28</a>)
any suggestions on updating the query so that it will display the uploaded images?
thanks from brazil o/
const {createReadStream, filename} = await file<br />createReadStream is not function.. how to solve?
thanks a lot
I&#39;m new to using GCS and would please like to know how to retrieve a file after I&#39;ve uploaded it. Thanks
allUsers access gives an error anymore

A trick : watch series on Flixzone. Me and my gf have been using it for watching loads of movies during the lockdown.
@Dillon Kobe yea, I have been watching on flixzone for years myself =)
@Dillon Kobe Definitely, I&#39;ve been watching on Flixzone for since december myself =)
Thank you soo much! Helped me a lot.
It does not charge you until you manually switch to a paid membership.

Quick update, Angular code is up to date now too! Sorry it took awhile, folks were traveling. :)
We&#39;re recovering from the conference. Hopefully this week we&#39;ll clean the code up a bit and publish it out and post the GitHub repo. Stay tuned!
Alrighty, we&#39;re still doing some cleanup on it, but the code repo for each piece can be found here: <br /><a href="https://github.com/GabeWeiss/GoogleIoTCoreApp">https://github.com/GabeWeiss/GoogleIoTCoreApp</a>
Angular still being updated to what we ended up with on stage, so stay tuned on that piece. Rest is good to go.
Where can we get the code for this presentation ?
Great to hear that, Saurabh. Code sample is in <a href="https://github.com/GabeWeiss/GoogleIoTCoreApp">https://github.com/GabeWeiss/GoogleIoTCoreApp</a> in case you need it.
Thank you for this session <br /><br />I have planned to work on real time reporting of Home health and display graphs using Angular<br /><br />This presentation will definitely help me
awesome
impressive thank you
BigQuery is the storage and analytics in one. Because of it being designed for extremely large data sets there&#39;s a fairly heavy cost to running queries against it. If your data set is relatively small (GBs, and potentially TBs depending on schema) a query might be able to finish in the tens of seconds neighborhood. I.e. still not real time, or even real near time. You can, and what we recommend even, build some real time analytics into whichever piece is pulling the data into BigQuery. So in a Cloud Function for example.<br /><br />Grain of salt, this all depends on use case of course. If you only care about seeing reports on the data every minute, for example, you may be able to get away with using BigQuery directly, but I&#39;d still suggest using some other data warehouse for real time.<br /><br />Hopefully this helps. If you want to connect on LinkedIn if you have more questions I&#39;m happy to chat more.
great presentation well done
Very nice. Thank you.
There are plans to update it, so keep your eye out for further details rolling out. No timeline I can provide you however.
Does anyone know if google has any plans to update iot core? seems like last update was in early of 2019
Hi guys, is there any discord channel for GCP iot?
You can download the RDP file or you can install Windows Remote Desktop on either platform (Mac/Windows) and that should work also.
Do i really need to download the rdp file? as i dont know if i can continue without it.
I have the same problem
Why does the server run so slow when I&#39;m setting it up?
good video bro,bu can i use the vps to run social media bots like pinflux etc
thanks for the detailed video :)
really helpful great video
Son_ Gokuo You don’t need a server to go manual no, but if it’s better connectivity to the internet, closer to the shopify servers or wherever you’re trying to cop from, and an overall better computer than yours at home, then it can defiantly help when going manual.
This might be a dumb question but do you have to use this when going manual?
same here, i guess no more free server 2020
It wont charge you until your free credits run out, just upgrade then cancel when your 300 is up
@Spooky Jenkins so now i have to delete my card and billing ?
@Tashmit Singh where do you redeem bro ? I can’t find it
Just go to the home page and make sure you redeem the 300 dollar credit. <br />After that you will be able to use this
@Miguel Bernal I just find it on the home page itself buddy. Make sure you have not used that account before for Google cloud
Windows vm instances are not included with the free trial to use them first enable billing on your account? Thats what it tells me any way u can help me get passed this i have my card on there
hi im trying to setup google server and when i get to the end after i put server name and password im getting a error that i cannot connect any suggestions i appreciate the feedback
@F.B.I bruh how is he stupid for asking a normal question
@F.B.I that doesn&#39;t make him stupid; it would be stupid if it was common knowledge but it was a simple misconception that literally anyone could have made
@F.B.I i didnt say he doesn&#39;t know it was a server i was implying that he might have thought you could play on a server two different things
@F.B.I can&#39;t read?
lmao youre so stupid.
@Troy seriously? “will it run fortnite?” a server isnt a fucking PC, its a huge box you host things with on the cloud.
@Troy “simple misconception” boy, the title of the video legit says “google cloud server” lmfao
@Troy the fuck?
@Troy no who the fuck plays on a server i mean i get “online multiplayer” where u CONNECT to servers but what?? lmao the kid is probably 8
probably just some kid who doesnt have a gaming pc and wants something good
will it run fortnite
You sir <b>sips tea</b> are one boneheaded bastard
it tells me to find the domain name, wtf is that
Connor Brooks hey there, just try to regenerate a key from the key pair and copy that new one to clipboard and paste it in the credentials part.
@Jeauxy Thanks for the (very quick) response. If you are referring to generating new passwords, I tried doing that 4 or 5 times. Is that what you mean? If not, what is a key pair?
@Connor Brooks click the more options thing under it and retype the username, you probably have a different username so the password isnt working
What&#39;s up man? Thanks for the video. Everything worked well for me but I ran into 1 major issue and was hoping you would be able to help me with it. When I went to make the connection from the VM Instance to the server I created, I typed in my username and the exact password it gave me. It keeps telling me my credentials used to connect to (IP Address) did not work and to enter new credentials. Do you have any insight on this?
it&#39;s for botting shoes etc. not specifically just buying shoes
how did you do it bro? sme problem but I dont know what to do
Quota &#39;C2_CPUS&#39; exceeded. Limit: 0.0 in region us-east1.<br />any idea please?
im confused? you use this to buy shoes? cant you just do that on any computer?
Gerard Rico I just rebooted my pc into its original Mac OS which you can only do if you have a Mac
i get a black screen when i open the rdp file and it pops up with a terminal saying administration, how do I fix<br /><br />fixed my shit lol thanks
@Knight that just means the card isnt available, so u either gotta wait or try different region
TO ANYBODY WITH THE ISSUE OF HAVING THE WRONG PASSWORD - when you set your windows password for the first time, it will popup with a username, change that username to something simple. After you OK the username, it then gives you the password. Copy that password, and when you boot up, it will show the username of a nonexistent computer cloud. Change that username in more options on windows, and there should be that option on Mac as well. Then you can paste the password. Msg me if you&#39;re still confused.
don’t forget that your server ip is different now, so u have to use your server ip and put it in your proxy
Hey bro, for some reasons when i test my proxies on my server they are failing like crazy. These are dcs as well and really really good proxies. Any idea why?
Thanks that&#39;s very useful 👍🏻
You have to upgrade to pro
If i have windows 10 home will this still work?
excellent Thank you for Help :-)
Sometimes firewall does affect .. am sure by now u have figured it out..
Can you help me out? I&#39;m stuck setting up my server. I can&#39;t get the remote desktop part figured out. It&#39;s not working for me, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing wrong.
Connection to remote PC was lost. We’re trying to connect again. I keep getting this and everything freeze until the connection is back, any suggestions?
Thanks for the amazing detailed video but please I have few questions to ask for more clarification. 1. After creating the vps, can I upgrade some preferences like RAM size afterwards? 2. For running multiple forex trading accounts with EA robots, what features are necessary for proper functioning of the vps? 3. Whenever I encounter the error message which says “can not connect to server for one of these reasons” during re-login, what do I do from the google cloud platform to make it right? 4. Please do you have any comprehensive video or article or a book that explains everything about windows vps? Thank you!😊
Me too. I dont get it.. something wrong we did?
I had the same issue. <br />Before watching this video I used 2019 windows data center. <br />After watching this, I thought let me try 2016, and it worked. <br />Really don&#39;t know what caused it?<br />What i could suggest is to change some configuration while setting up<br />Thanks
i have a black screen on windows need help
This is awesome - what is one click? Also how to I connect a bot to the server ?
Brilliant video. I can now bot on my chrome book 😂
Mac has an inbuilt screen recorder. <br />It records at 1440 p or higher

Hey! Just a quick question, do I need to make a new server everytime I want to go for a drop? Or is it possible to like pause a server and save all the settings and then just load it up when I need it again?
It says I need to activate recurring billing, but i can’t find where to turn that on
what location should my server be if im in canada and im botting ftlca?
Just saved my life<br />Thanks man

Use better mic.... <br />😊😊☹🙃🙁💯
You wouldn&#39;t want to and no. Dataproc is a manager Hadoop cluster which performs better with a huge dataset - which is generally batch data. Plus running a DataProc cluster is very expensive. If you want to process streaming data, you are better off using Pub/Sub or a Kafka Cluster
Hi, will you pls share how did you add big query connectors with zeppelin? it is giving me errors when i try to access data set in pyspark using zeppelin.
Why can&#39;t we use Dataproc to process streaming data? <br />Thanks :)

Is my plaback on 3x speed? hint hint
Love you google that we can trust 😘😘😘
Good Information to start from the Scratch!!
Can you share the difference which you have observed from AWS to Google Cloud?
Thanks man!
I added my notes to the description section, please feel free to comment there if you want to add more to the notes. Thanks
@Cloud Advocate thank you for the wonderful video..
Can u share the study notes docs ?? It will be more helpful to prepare.
@Cloud Advocate What is the prerequisite for the certification, any tutorial or link that can help someone without prior cloud experience ?
I took 3 months because I had to prepare only during weekends. If you put more effort and have prior cloud experience shouldn&#39;t take that long. You can even do it in less than 2 months.
Thank you for the informative illustration, any recommendation about the optimal time period to do a sufficient preparation as of some one who has no prior knowledge about GCP.
So good thing about cloud technologies are they are all pretty much similar. For example you will have compute everywhere, in AWS or GCP. The developer experience might change. I would suggest to pick up anything and start. If you want to get a job may be look at how much of market share each of them has. Like AWS is around 50% Azure and GCP are trying to catch up. Hope it helps !
If your stepping into IT and want to study cloud would you recommend this over all the other cloud platforms?
Nope, it&#39;s all about infrastructure services and logical thinking like how you would solve this using GCP services.
I would start with knowing what is cloud computing ? why its use ? There are basic tutorials available on YouTube. Once you are familiar then start working on GACE
Thanks for all the information. Do you need to have a background in Software development and programming languages to pass this test?
Sure
Please create watsapp group so that will be helpful

@Cloud Advocate can you please suggest what are the things to be learned in infra services and linux ?
So I would suggest to learn the basics of infrastructure services and be strong on Linux. Once you get these 2 start playing around by signing up for the free account on any cloud AWS or Google.
I am very new to cloud platform. Can you tell me from where I should start with ?? From what language as base and from there wat are pre knowledge I should have to come to cloud platform? <br />Thanks much
I haven&#39;t created any group yet Kiran.

Thanks Nitin, may be I will create a video on that<br /><br />Edit: Nitin, please check latest video and let me know if that is helpful.
Hi. Good video. Am new to cloud. I have a networking background and i want to get into cloud. Can u suggest me a learning statergy for cloud ?
Hi,<br />I have cleared the Google Cloud Associate cloud engineer exam.<br />How can I get the certificate and cup?<br />Thanks in advance for your reply...<br />:)
Thanks a lot for your tips. Really helped a lot. And I also took practice tests from Skillcertpro and it really prepared me well for the exam in last 2 days. I finally cleared it..
I failed the exam on the 30th of June 2020. As you say in your video, questions are quite hard, and so far, I didn&#39;t find any practice exam on the internet with the same degree of difficulty as on the real exam. I got to keep learning, and I welcome your recommendation on which specific topic I should spend the most time on.
@Anitha Kalepi Well done Anitha. I hope to be as successful as you in a couple of weeks.
@Cloud Advocate VPN and VPC were particularly challenging.
@Cloud Advocate I&#39;m going to watch AND study absolutely all your videos related to the Associate exam.
@Cloud Advocate This is very kind of you, thank you so much.<br />A friend of mine just passed the exam 4 days ago. He went through the 4 trial exams on this udemy course. He told me that many questions he got during the exam were very similar to the 4th trial exam. He said that if someone can pass this 4th exam with 80% on the first attempt, he should be fine with the real exam. I hope that can help some of you.<br /><a href="https://www.udemy.com/share/102NAwA0ETdVxUQ34=/">https://www.udemy.com/share/102NAwA0ETdVxUQ34=/</a>
I have passed the exam but received no mug ☹️ .
I will create a video on that, it should help you .<br /><br />Edit: Please check latest video and let me know if that&#39;s helpful.
Hii sir, I want to be a cloud engineer then please tell the beginning process and other various methods to become a cloud engineer
Good question, there are few people who got that way. Let me be honest with you, there are more opportunities for experienced like any other technology.
@Cloud Advocate Thanks for the quick reply can I get your LinkedIn
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/chaitanya-gk">www.linkedin.com/in/chaitanya-gk</a>
Can you get job as a fresher if we have both associate and professional cloud certification?
@Darkteckh on telegram is a real vendor I can’t believe my eyes that man too real Go on his telegram He sell credit card with high balance✅
Great Info..Thank you
Good Vid Bro! Thanks for Sharing!
I haven&#39;t got single question on quotas. It&#39;s not important for exam.
I read your study notes in docs.. What are questions we can expect from quotas.. You have shared link for few services quota.. It will be helpful if you have share on that as it is difficult to remember all limits

NO.1 You need to grant access for three users so that they can view and edit table data on a Cloud
 <br />Spanner instance. What should you do?
 <br />A. Run gcloud iam roles describe roles/spanner.viewer - -project my-project. Add the users to a new
 <br />group. Add the group to the role.
 <br />B. Run gcloud iam roles describe roles/spanner.databaseUser. Add the users to the role.
 <br />C. Run gcloud iam roles describe roles/spanner.viewer - -project my-project. Add the users to the
 <br />role.
 <br />D. Run gcloud iam roles describe roles/spanner.databaseUser. Add the users to a new group. Add the
 <br />group to the role.<br /><br />What would be the answer B or D??

Every employee of your company has a Google account. Your operational team needs to manage a
 <br />large number of instances on Compute Engine. Each member of this team needs only administrative
 <br />access to the servers. Your security team wants to ensure that the deployment of credentials is
 <br />operationally efficient and must be able to determine who accessed a given instance. What should
 <br />you do?
 <br />A. Generate a new SSH key pair. Give the private key to each member of your team. Configure the
 <br />public key in the metadata of each instance.
 <br />B. Ask each member of the team to generate a new SSH key pair and to send you their public key.
 <br />Use a configuration management tool to deploy those keys on each instance.
 <br />C. Ask each member of the team to generate a new SSH key pair and to add the public key to their
 <br />Google account. Grant the “compute.osAdminLogin” role to the Google group corresponding to this
 <br />team.
 <br />D. Generate a new SSH key pair. Give the private key to each member of your team. Configure the
 <br />public key as a project-wide public SSH key in your Cloud Platform project and allow project-wide
 <br />public SSH keys on each instance.<br /><br />What would be the answer C or D
@Cloud Advocate Is there anything i need to learn before i start with ACE preparartion.
@Cloud Advocate Ok Thank you
Yes!!
Don&#39;t worry, just start and you will learn by yourself by practicing.
I am a full fresher can I able to do it?
Thanks and I didn&#39;t use any dumps.
<a href="https://www.examtopics.com/exams/google/">https://www.examtopics.com/exams/google/</a>
Hi Bro thanks for your informative content can you share which vendor dumps you use to prepare your self for exam
Hi Gk, I am preparing for the associate cloud engineer exam, as you mentioned the exam guide has the list of topics to be prepared for the exam. There are 5 main topics with sub topics under it. Is there a link/course or reference material which would cover most of these topics. So that i can learn through it and use the Google credit $300 and start practicing. Or should i have to google out these sub topics seperately and learn it from different links or portals. Thanks again for sharing these videos it is helping me take the right path and approach.
Hey Anoop, there is a a link in the description.
Hi GK, Thanks for sharing this valuable information
Mate....have asked for some study material...<br />Thanks for your wishes bro
@Cloud Advocate bro...you have talked about some study materials that you have prepared and the entire details of hyperlinks given by someone you admire...<br />On your video you have talked about sharing the same....<br />Please lemme have it ASAP.
@Cloud Advocate but I couldn&#39;t find &#39;em...<br />Will you please do me this favor
hi mate,<br />Thanks for the guidance...<br />bro,share me anything that you have,that you think would be helpful for me to pass the exam...<br />I am a complete non technical fellow,but willing to dive into GCP ocean...<br />Help me to stay afloat...<br />thanks again.
Thanks Paul.
Really helpful - thanks so much for this. And well done for passing!
Thanks Farid, will do.
Thanks for this. Can you please remove the edit access to your google document. There are a lot of unnecessary changes/deletion.
No Sergio, I haven&#39;t used whizlabs.
Thanks for all the detailed notes. I also have some other cloud certs but figured I&#39;d at least try getting the ACE from google. Have you ever used Whizlabs? They usually have some good sample questions that help me at least know what to practice and be prepared for. I&#39;ll go through your sheet as well as the Whizlabs and give it a try. Cheers
AWS to start with and definitely learn Google cloud, it has great potential.
Im planning to learn cloud Which one is best AWS Azure or GCP ?
multicloudguy@<a href="http://gmail.com/">gmail.com</a>
Bro can I get your email ID to contact and I have some questions to ask..
Its price calculator right? I didn&#39;t follow your question.
@Cloud Advocate yes ...
What type of questions can we expect from price calculator
@Deepti Nair Oh, don&#39;t worry too much about it. I don&#39;t remember I got any questions.
@Cloud Advocate lol thanks, I saw it in your notes and hence was trying to get my head around, what could they possibly ask. Thanks, hope I can ask you more doubts here.
@Deepti Nair Sure, I can answer here.
Hello again ,another question is custom image another name for snapshots , this is in context of snapshot under compute engine section, thanks again, appreciate your help
@Deepti Nair snapshots word is generally used in the context of volumes.
what questions do they ask for under : <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/#id=d9363a17-2911-4389-8eed-9b9a53443630">https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/#id=d9363a17-2911-4389-8eed-9b9a53443630</a> ??
Nope, I am not aware of it.
Your organization can help you with that, they will have discounted vouchers.
Sir, may I know is there any option to get free voucher to write exam
Yes, that and practice on the console.
@Cloud Advocate bro im really excited to get certified..recently i started with the app engine,deployed a project in flex..I cant afford coursera its like 3000bucks..There is course in Udemy by Acloudgurus(Mattias Andersson) which i can afford its a 15hrs course would that be sufficient?....Thank You
I hope you were using your debit card GCP don&#39;t accept debit card. You have use a valid credit card. It helped me .Hope this will help
I did not face the issue. What error are you getting?
Hey..great video...thanks for uploading...I need your help...while i am creating free-tier account , after giving the credit/debit card info, it is always getting stuck with verify payment alert...It is not allowing me to use the account...Did you face this? Could you able to guide me in fixing this...i have used multiple cards with different merchants...
How to do this via cloud shell command line??!!
Did you get it?
@Cloud Advocate I passed the exam on 6th March and received certification as well, please tell how can I get cup?
Congratulations Deepti. You should get soon hopefully. I am not sure if anything got changed recently.
@Cloud Advocate thank you, hope
@manoj goli no manoj still I didn&#39;t get it
I cleared my certification on 6th March how can I get cup as I didn&#39;t received any merchandise mail
I took 2 months..coz mostly during weekends. I registered when few weeks before the exam.
@Cloud Advocate Thanks for that.. Any details on exam dates? Like we have to take it by so months or so?
I took in US...dates are available. You can get dates easily.
@Cloud Advocate Appreciate for the time and patience. Kudos to you
Can you tell me about the timeframe for exam preparation once we register?<br />How was your study curve?
You&#39;re welcome!
thanks
I don&#39;t think so. You can try giving Indian debit card. I have used cc though.
What is the direct debit option for creating free trial account. Is it even any method exist to create free trial account via direct debit option ?
1) I can only speak on AWS and GCP. Not familiar with Azure. I felt GCP associate was tougher than aws.<br />2) Don&#39;t worry about language, you can start with whatever you know.<br />3) I took 3 months for GCP but before that I have good knowledge on AWS. If you work hard, you can as well do it in less time.<br />4) Any cloud is good to get a good job. Pick one and go for it.
@Cloud Advocate thanks a lot Sir..!
Bit long but kindly help...<br />I am a SQL ETL Developer..zero in cloud as of now.Looking for tech improvement..future perspective<br />1)AWS/Azure/GCP which is easy to crack associate developer certificate (kindly order on basis of difficulty level)<br />2) Any prerequisites for AWS/GCP/Azure (language/shell scripts/unix /networking)<br />3) Average time for preparation from zero to certificate clearance(i know this varies but just for idea)<br />AWS,GCP,Azure<br />4) which is best for getting a new job in case i get handson and certificate
Can I do this with my android phone
Bro GCP ACE ki video dekh rhe ho, itna complex aur valuable exam ki preperation bhi krni hai but.<br />English jaisi easy language ko weak keh rhe ho.
Sir plese hindi me video banaya Karo plese because English is weak
Apply to jobs :)
Sir, what after we get certification. Do we become a google employee or we have to apply elsewhere ?
My pleasure!
Thank you for sharing!
@Darkteckh on telegram is a real vendor I can’t believe my eyes that man too real Go on his telegram He sell credit card with high balance✅
Oh man. After all the study and exam worth $$$. You get a cup :)
THANK YOU
Nope
Is there any coding in this?
Someone from scratch can do it as well.
@Cloud Advocate Thank you! Will you please recommend a course on Udemy since there is an offer going on?
You missed the bus my friend <a href="https://youtu.be/LcJjZs4ve4A">https://youtu.be/LcJjZs4ve4A</a>
@Cloud Advocate Never mind. Thanks a lot :)
Will let you know as in when I get something.
Hey! In coursera course do you need to have a basic knowledge ? Or someone from scratch can start to? Also, what are requirements?
Good luck Charles!!
Thank you. This video was very helpful. I plan to start studying for this exam soon.
It doesn&#39;t matter Varun, whichever is cheaper.
@Cloud Advocate Thanks for the confirmation 👍
Thanks for sharing such a valuable information....<br />As I can see in Udemy acloudguru videos are available.... could you please confirm shall I go with the acloudguru content available in Udemy or practice through official site of acloudguru
My pleasure!
Thank you for sharing your experience
Glad it was helpful!
@Cloud Advocate i passed my ACE last wednesday and got my official cert 2 days after the exam. today i got an email from google to invite me for their community. i am now preparing myself for pca using LA course. Really excited about the journey. it took me nearly 2 months from knowing nothing about gcp to having done many labs, courses and revision from different sources like reading the full Dan&#39;s thick exam guide book and ensure the checklist from you and google exam guide completed with my studies. the 2 months i spent really focused and determined due to lockdown.
Awesome WS!! And congratulations!!..I am glad I was helpful. Did my videos on GCP helped you to pass the exam? Any feedback on topics I am missing would be helpful. Thank you for letting me know.
@Cloud Advocate Hi Cloud Advocate. I passed my PCA today after 2 weeks passing ACE. Your topics are very detailed and covered really a lot. i really went and studied one by one. just that some you didn&#39;t include links for some topics you pointed out. Overall i think all should follow the study practice you share both for passing exam and build more solid foundation.
@WS Congratulations!!
@Cloud Advocate Thank you!
@WS hey whats courses u followed for clearing ACE exam can u pls share the course names, wher to practise exam , labs nd order u followed pls pls
@Usha Sree hi. I used plurasight for the foundation course. The course would not be enuf. I practised a lot by using qwicklab. After that i read a book from dan. Practised some tests there for understanding. Went tru all the exam guide to make sure i focused and prepared enuf on those topics.
you brought up a very good point for me - the tutorial for the services! that&#39;s i missed.
It takes time, don&#39;t worry as long as you have seen pass result :)
@Cloud Advocate thank you :) since taking time little worried.. <br />Result showed pass in webassesor account where i have taken exam
Thanks for sharing.. <br />Can you also share how long google cloud sent you certificate after completing exam.. <br />I have written on may 13th but so far no mail confirmation..
Yes and my videos ;)
Is Acloudguru course alone enough? Or you need to refer both?
Thank you and good luck!!
Thank you for the notes! I&#39;ll be working towards this cert once I get the MCSA cert completed. The notes look very thorough!
Credit card is the only option I am aware of.
Thanks for guiding and sharing your journey.I was just starting out and was facing difficulty creating free tier account as most of the debit/credit cards are not being <a href="http://accepted.so/">accepted.so</a>, is there any other possible way for creating free tier account.
You can mail me or contact over LinkedIn
@Cloud Advocate thank you sir
Sir I wanted to talk to you personally for a while related to cloud computing sir , could i ?
Sure Shweta, will try to make something on that..thank you.
Hey,<br />Nice video<br />Can you make a video where u will be guiding us how to get started with GCP. How can we go from beginner level to an intermediate level of understanding GCP and so on. Is there any guided path way tht u can explain us to get into GCP and then we can keep exploring all about it... Just the foundation is imp.... I have gone throught the Google cloud platform website and for me it looked scattered like there is Linux there is Infrastructure services mentioned and many many big terms... So can u guide us with some path?
Not necessary, but atleast python would help.
Hi , Is Any programming language a pre-requiresuite to learn google cloud ?? I have no knowledge on any programming language except SQL
This certification will help you at-least get shortlisted for interview and know the person who is reviewing your resume will know that you have basic understanding of cloud, rest is your efforts to crack the interview and once you are in then you can learn on floor and doing projects.. Remember Certifications will just give opportunity to get selected from crowd but grabbing that is in your hands.. All the best
After this certification can anyone get a job ? How much salary one can expect?
Very subjective, based on your background. But you can try and crack it in 2-3 months if you put effort...or may be less.
How many months will be sufficient to prepare for the exam for a beginner ?
If you want to make a career in cloud, sure. You have put more effort since are not in IT.
I am a management accounting university student and this cloud certification caught my attention... Do you think this certification will help or should I find other certifications in my field?
@Cloud Advocate what are the course era courses u recommend
Did you applied for any job after that? How does it value your carrier in Cloud?
Congratulations!!
I have just cleared GCP ACE Exam. Thanks for the tips as they helped me a lot!!!
Practice a lot!! practice everything that&#39;s part of the study guide and it should be enough.
Hey guy, thanks for information. Now I am learning GCP and studying to apply Associate. I am studing by Coursera. I don´t know if is enough to make a test. Thanks
Thank you!! Associate cloud engineer is the first gcp cert and time depends on your skill level. Might take 2 months.
Great video sir, I am a fresher and wants to go for gcp certification so wanted to know that which certification should i do first and approx how much time do i need to have an good overview of all the topics
Glad it was helpful!
Very helpful, thank you!
Thanks for sharing Saurabh. Did you find my videos helpful for the exam?
@Cloud Advocate You have got amazing videos and highly appreciate for all the efforts you are taking to help others, unfortunately I found your videos after taking the ACE exam. I am going through them and I am sure it will be of great help for GCP professional Cloud Architect certification. Thank you !!
@Saurabh Kumar Thank you!!
I just cleared GCP ACE last week. I anticipated it to be easy and expected only basic questions regarding GCP components. But it was much more then that. Was anyway able to clear it since I am mainly preparing for GCP architect certification. You really need to have good understanding and some hands on for most of the components, specially GKE, GCE and Storages. One thing I would like to mention that, there were many questions from IAM and Stackdriver, so prepare that well whoever plans to appear for ACE certification. Thank you :)
Listed down commands for preparation<br /><a href="https://www.motsfontana.com/associate-cloud-engineer-certification-google-cloud-common-commands/">https://www.motsfontana.com/associate-cloud-engineer-certification-google-cloud-common-commands/</a>

thank you so much for explaining your process
Hi I want to talk personally regarding cloud computing.. please share your linkedin I&#39;d please.
No
@Cloud Advocate thanks for the reply but I have another doubt how much is the cost for the course totally??
You can start with my playlist and study guide.
Should I know any kind of programing languages to pass the exam??
Hey what source of study you chose to clear the exam ?
I am thinking the same. Cleared my exam and got the certificate today
@Ritesh Agrahari hey Ritesh, i went through the course on Acloud guru and the percipio material which I feel is superb. 😀
Hi, I just got my ACE certification. Am I going to receive a Google cloud Mug as well? If so how do I go about receiving it? Please let me know. Thanks!
There is Google cloud professional architect exam..if that&#39;s what you are asking about.
Hi .. actually i want guidance from you ...is there a exam for architecting with google compute engine .... if it is there what criteria we need to give that exam ...i have googled it but i am confused
I added few and videos to the link.
New link is in the description.
@Cloud Advocate Actually I just wanted to know if you have edited that doc file
Yes I did
@Cloud Advocate...... Have you added some more references to the original document of study note ?
Acloudguru or Courseera? Can u suggest one please based on your experience
How do you give your exam?
Congratulations 🎉🎊
@Cloud Advocate Thanks to you for your contributions, I have a question, how do I claim the Google Cloud certification merchandise?
Thanks for the tips! yesterday was my ACE certification and I passed it!
Congratulations 🎊🎈
Cloud Advocate Thanku so much 😊
Did you go through my playlist? Anything to improve?
Cloud Advocate I like the playlist.. now I am preparing for professional cloud architect exam..
@hemlata kalwani good luck!!
I gave my exam today and passed 😊 thanks for the tips
Hi Ishank, I am not sure coz I had free account with the company...take whatever is lowest or buy their udemy course by same author.
@Cloud Advocate Hi, no Udemy course by same author. Actually i have heard shoutouts for this Linux academy course by author Matthew ulasien. So keen to learn from him now.. Udemy course has bas reviews for GCP cloud architect training on their website itself.
But the problem is, Linux academy is 31 dollars per month, not on course basis... Much more than Udemy.. hahaha.
This is the URL <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/google-certified-associate-cloud-engineer/">https://www.udemy.com/course/google-certified-associate-cloud-engineer/</a> yeah..it&#39;s expensive.
@Cloud Advocate Thankyou for the info.. But the thing is I&#39;m looking for architect course not associate.. Nevertheless, thanks for your time. 🙂👍
@Ishank Aggarwal Okay yeah I forgot..your already done with ACE.
Hi Cloud Advocate, I was going through ACloudGuru(Linux Academy) website and they have 2 plans &#39;Personal Basic&#39; and &#39;Personal Plus&#39;... Can &#39;Personal Basic&#39; with one month subscription enough to go through the GCP training (Cloud Architect)<br />? Please guide.
Hello, You do not have to buy, please start with my playlist and then start practicing both topics and questions. I wish you good luck!
I had applied to Google Associate Cloud engineer course. I am a <a href="http://b.com/">b.com</a> graduate. I am new to cloud &amp; It. From coursers video lectures. I can&#39;t understand. Right now I am unemployed &amp; facing financial problems. For sign up in acloud guru site they are asking money. I can&#39;t afford to pay for it. You please guide me to crack Google associate cloud engineer. examination.
Objective
Google Associate Engineer exam is objective type or written examination.
You can take from home but can&#39;t keep notes.
Hi since we are impacted by covid for travelling can you give exam from your home location? And if yes what are the prep required for exam desk preparation. Can I keep the command notes handy?
thanks for the guidelines . i m start the practices from now. 🙏
Thank you!
Man you spread the experience like a big bro..cheers man.
Congratulations 🎉🎊🥳 Priya!! And thanks for taking time put comment..means a lot.
@Cloud Advocate can u guide me what exam should I take next at professional level? There are many and I am not clear with which exam I should go ahead
Hi @cloud advocate , I saw your video before starting my prep for exam. It definitely motivated me though I couldnt go through the content shared by you. Good thing is I have cleared the Associate xam and got my certificate today. Thanks for helping out people . <br />I will be preparing for professional architect exam now. ☺
If you ask me to pick one, I would pick python.
Is there any programming language need to became a cloud engineear
Hi please guide me what is that a QA need to do extra and will it benefit in switching to be a Cloud engineer. Thanks in Advance.
Hi, do u hv dumps? Plz share
Congratulations 🎉🎊🥳!
Thank you for your video, I went through quite few of them and passed my ACE exam yesterday. Really helpful.
Yes and practice a lot along with that.
Is coursera enough for preparation of ACE certification
Sir can i get your LinkedIn id i want to connect with u please sir
Congratulations Aman!!
Your suggestions were very helpful. I gave the exam just a while back and passed it. Thanks
Depends on you, I took I think around 2 months studying only weekends while doing full time job. But you can do faster as well.
@Cloud Advocate yeah thanks bro. May be it will be helpful to me
@Cloud Advocate yeah bro can you make a video on complete overview of compute, networking, storage and tools and how it will be use in a project
Hai bro I have a doubt. How much time it&#39;s take to cover all the contents which are present in the notes which you have prepared
What course you picked from coursera ? For this exam
Nope
is there pre-requisite for certifications...
Thanks for tips and guidance to start the GCP journey , these are precious.
I got a coupon after few days not sure what&#39;s going on now
@Cloud Advocate Thank you for the reply. Google stopped giving gifts for Associate level certification
Hello. You motivated me in passing my Google Cloud Associate Exam. Thank you. I wanted to ask you, how did you got the CUP which you mentioned in the starting of this video. I did not received any stuff from Google?
Yes now they are coz of covid-19
Thank you for your tips... is that google cloud associate certification exams conducted via online? As in Aws?
You got the sequence right :). Aws is still leading currently. But that shouldn’t stop you to learn GCP. I would suggest do your own research on based on job sites and go for any cloud.
I heard you mentioned multi cloud. Which one should you start with if you live Northern Va where majority of the Cloud Servers in the US are located? I see AWS first Azure second and GCP last. In Reston Va 20190 in a 15 mile radius there are a lot of jobs.
I am not aware of that certification. But, I would suggest you can start directly.
@Cloud Advocate I guess, because I am on the outside looking in what other certifications do I need like Operating Systems, Coding Languages, Containers? I am sure just getting this certification is not the only thing I need to know, but I am not sure what is more used. No one will talk about this to go along with these certifications.
Right, there are certifications in every tech you choose..like RHCA etc. I would suggest to pick them wisely that would help your career.
Do you think the Linux Foundation Cloud Bootcamp certification would go well with GCP and AWS certification?
Congratulations 👏 👏
Thank you!! You have very good documentation like AWS does and tons of youtube videos :).
@Cloud Advocate <br />You are a super advocate I could utter. Saw different videos of yours &amp; could just speak out one phrase, &quot;awesome throughout&quot; :) <br /><br />Highly appreciate if you could suggest any YouTube playlist that is organized &amp; cover the whole path(s). Thank you
Firstly thank you for the insightful real time scenarios. Kudos 👍<br /><br />Do we have official Google cloud platform training with videos like that of <a href="http://aws.training/">aws.training</a>. If so please do share. Thank you
Thanks ! Really Useful Stuffs . How long you took to complete GCP Certification and how many questions will b asked ?
Be positive, you will get.
I&#39;m in e commerce Amazon ,I&#39;m interested in learning GCP or Azure .Even I have knowledge in .net with 1 year exp ,after having gap in my career .if I passed one of the certificate their is a chance of getting job ?
Thanks for your guidance to start my GCP journey
Multiple choices
I wonder if the exam format is just questions with multiple choices or any lab works..?
Yes, you have to pay again.
To retake gcp ace exam do we need to register again?
It was free for me. Please pick whichever is cheaper for you.
Hi Could you please tell which plan you took on acloud Guru. Becuase I can see its paid plans starting from 31$ per month where as their Udemy course cost 474Rs .....Please suggest
No Im pretty sure it&#39;s more about using the gcp user interface and maybe knowing a couple of Linux type commands
Hallo sir where can i learn this for free and i dont know if this question os dumb but do i need to use a Programm language if So can i use phython <br />Thank you
Voice is very low . difficult to understand
Yes
I am from Java background and don&#39;t have prior experience on cloud. Can I start from scratch as I want to change my career platform.
Hi GK, kindly share your mail I&#39;d if possible to ask some clarification on Google cloud Certification result
i watch you video, i wanted to do associate exam - how i do to start.
AWS will give you opportunity to learn more services
hello sir, I am a student. should i go for aws or google cloud ?
Thanks for this informative video now I know how to proceed for the certification.
Yes you definitely can. Prepare a schedule each day and most importantly practice a lot

You helped me pass the GCP Associate test...Thank you!
Hey Vishal, we do not have a tutorial on that for now. Subscribe to us and stay connected, we update our channel regularly. Cheers :)
sir plz made video on <br />what is natural language processing??
Natural-language processing (NLP) is an area of computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to fruitfully process large amounts of natural language data.<br />Hope this helps :)
edureka! <br />thank you
what is natural language processing??
Hey Rahul, thank you for watching our video. We are glad that you liked it. We do not have a tutorial on chat bots as of yet. Subscribe to our channel and stay tuned for all the latest updates. Cheers :)
Sir, Thanks a lot giving information about new technologies, it helps me to improve and updating my knowledge. Also I have to know about chatbot Technology if any video is uploaded from your channel reply me. Finally thanks a lot..
This is my first time looking into the cloud solutions that are offered in the industry. Excellent overview! Thank you!
Awesome
Thank you
Help....Thankyou
Wow!!! It&#39;s really interesting like always . . . Kudos GCP :)
Thanks for the wonderful content!!! The recent series of GCP episodes by you guys are really worth of watching in a fun oriented way.
excellent content. Thanks for sharing
5 stars Google, ld gladly give this to them for taking open source computing to the next level.
Awesome, just really !! You&#39;ll should make the migration series into a playlist so we don&#39;t miss any of them
Really great content!
How do you decide the migration type without assessing cloud adoption &amp; inventory assessment? I think the migration type step has to come after evaluating cloud adoption framework? Ex., The migration type i decide in replatform, but when I assess using the framework my objective is to reduce cost which is life &amp; shift, I feel both these steps need to be realigned properly.
It is always a Pleasure to watch the videos from Priyanka and the content is so rich and the duration of 5-10 min keeps the attention span and registers well with the viewers. Thank you Priyanka and Google team for such wonderful learning bytes.
FANTASTIC FROM LOW BALL TO TECHINCAL PURITY
in 5 step Kudos GCP :)
In the Cloud Maturity Scale - slide - there is a minor copy-paste error at the overlap cell of Transformational-x-Scale. The text should have been - &quot;All change is constant, low risk &amp; quickly fixed&quot;, as stated in Google Cloud Adoption Framework. @Google Cloud Tech <br>And Priyanka - you are fantastic!
I loved this platform
no, NO, how do i run my python code script!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i can&#39;t figure it out
Short and sweet. Thank you
Google VM is the best ever
are you Azure about that? =D<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />just joking
this is way easier than Azure 🤔
If only the SSH button was working.
ok meg
There is no CREATE/IMPORT/QUICK START BUTTONS theres just sign up for a free trial?
Hi there, I am trying to use Google Compute Engine to make aiohttp get requests, and I am unable to. Can someone assist me pls :)
 <br />I am using Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster) and aiohttp version 3.6.3
 <br />
 <br />Note: I have run the same code on my local machine with aiohttp requests with the same libraries and it works fine, so I know the issue is with Google Compute Engine.
Coming soon!

How is this cloud code different from gitkube? Is it not a security vulnerability to modify directly on prod and not go through some devops cycle? how would you sync the prod with your git repos?
Thanks🙏🙇

I am trying for that, meanwhile please find my gcp playlist.
@Cloud AdvocateSure,Thanks for planning to make videos, you already certified and you have high skills. If you cover all GCP concepts with examples that will be helpful for everyone
Make full course video for ACE. Include all services with example
Make complete video on ACE. Include all services in it
This is very informative! Thank you!!

Watch this at 1.5x speed with captions, you&#39;re welcome.
Any chance we can get these slides?
Excellent Video, very informative!
however he is master in this I can see he is reading the screen I can see his eyes haha
STILL WATCHING FIRST VIDEO but came here to say &quot;FIRST&quot;.........
That&#39;s certainly possible, I had not considered this. Bummer, I was super excited in my hopes that instead it&#39;d be coordinate locations on the screen haha.
Could locations be geolocation?<br /><br /><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2016/09/around-the-world-landmark-detection-with-the-cloud-vision-api">https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2016/09/around-the-world-landmark-detection-with-the-cloud-vision-api</a>
I was on the same train of thought. Why work on the virtual machine if you&#39;re just calling some API to do all the heavy lifting? I was to lazy to try it on my machine though. :) I guess your comment shed some light why sentdex did it on Google VM instead of his own machine. Or did it? :) Anyways, sentdex, great series of series of videos. I&#39;ve started with machine learning, and by now, I&#39;m hooked. :) Great stuff. Keep them coming.
Yes it&#39;s possible to code on a local machine. I&#39;m on Windows and use a Vagrant box with Ubuntu 14.04, virtualenv and code in PyCharm in my work. After launching Ubuntu via Vagrant and connecting to it using PuTTy you act as if you&#39;ve connected to Google virtual machine (as in this video). But to run python scripts in PyCharm additionally I also had to enter path to credentials file there (Run-&gt;Edit Configurations-&gt;Environment variables-&gt;add key &#39;GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS&#39; and path to json file (in my case &#39;/vagrant/....&#39;). P.s. Code in the video may be outdated or doesn&#39;t work on python3 - see comment by Doug Beney (worked for me). P.p.s. Thank you Sentdex!
Does anybody know if it is possible to run the API from a local machine. I have an Ubuntu machine with tensorflow-GPU and google cloud installed. <br /><br />I have created a project in google cloud, generated a key and enabled vision but I get &quot;Could not automatically determine credentials.&quot; <br /><br />Is what I&#39;m trying to do possible or am I making a stupid error?<br /><br />I answered my own question by actually reading the link that comes with the error. :p<br /><br />Follow the instructions the instructions in the above video until you have input the path for the key and then:<br /><br />Install Google Cloud SDK on your machine:<br /><a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart-debian-ubuntu">https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart-debian-ubuntu</a><br /><br />Run &#39;gcloud auth application-default login&#39; in a terminal and a browser window will come up asking you to sign your life away to google-ai.<br /><br />Then your machine should be authorized to use the API.<br /><br /><br />Great Video and happy computing.
1. It&#39;s not really root, but it&#39;s password-less sudo. You can just do su and be root too though. you&#39;re free to run it however you like though. <br />2. I didn&#39;t catch a &quot;bounds.&quot; Maybe I am blind :P. If it&#39;s there I&#39;ll be super excited.
You actually are root:<br />1 - you&#39;re command line starts with the user name, which in this case is root@...<br />2 - you have the &#39;#&#39; in the beginning of your prompt - which indicates that you are running as root<br />3 - in the first tutorial you entered &quot;sudo su&quot; - which makes you root user<br /><br />Type &#39;exit&#39; or hit Ctrl-d - and you&#39;ll be back on your regular user<br /><br />Update us regarding the bounds ;)<br /><br />And - thanks for your great tutorials - im learning something new every time!
Oh, I didn&#39;t notice I stayed as root after showing it, whoops. You don&#39;t need to be root, you can just use sudo where necessary. If the bounds really work, I will update for sure with drawing squares or something around the objects.
After poking into bounds, that sounds like it&#39;s what it should be, but it still returns nothing. I tried label._bounds.vertices, and it&#39;s all still empty :(((
Disappointing :(
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/crop-hints">https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/crop-hints</a>
 That&#39;s the closest that i found - tried it in their website, results are not accurate enough IMO<br /><br /><a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/">https://cloud.google.com/vision/</a> - you can drop an image there and get all the information they supply, visually and in json
1 - Why are you running as root?<br />2 - Maybe the &quot;bounds&quot; field of the label gives you the bounding box of the item in the image?
ha senior citizen classic
do you think &#39;location&#39; might be the meta data embedded within the image?
It prints a tuple. When using parenthesis, it works, but not the same as with Python 3.
Ok,<br />thank you
Hi!<br /><br />I have a question, why &quot;print()&quot; function works if you are using python 2.7?
haha i was like sitting asking myself how creating vision folder is enough for gcloud to know which api is needed
Is any one else facing same error? I am not able to get through it even if i use Vi editor.
yup same error here.
Make sure your Line 5 (private_key) is all in one &quot;continuous line&quot;. E.g., make sure there are no &#39;returns&#39; spreading the key across multiples lines. Mine was formatted with \n newline characters however was still split across two lines (as if somebody hit return halfway through private_key string). Once I deleted the return and put the key on a single line, no problem.
fixed it, still didn&#39;t pass :(
I used nano for editing, but only when I saved the json file again using vi it did work :)
Maybe too late for an answer but you used the path to root /root/gcloudstuff/apikey.json but you are more likely to have the apikey stored in your home directory. the command would be <br />export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/home/*random_number_of _folders*/apikey.json. try to use the full path from root to your file. Had the same problem with the root directory
getting error message while executing the code: &quot;&#39;File {} is not a valid json file.&#39;.format(filename), exc)<br />google.auth.exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError: (&#39;File /root/gcloudstuff/apikey.json is not a valid json file.&#39;, ValueError(&#39;Invalid control character at: line 5 column 38 (char 173)&#39;,))&quot; - my file looks similar to the one in the video... enabled api...not sure what&#39;s wrong..
isnt locations supposed to be gps coordinates (if included in photo metadata)?
As far as the coordinates of the labels, is that what this might be:<br /><a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/reference/rest/v1/images/annotate#BoundingPoly">https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/reference/rest/v1/images/annotate#BoundingPoly</a>
Nope, you can run it from your home computer too if you like. I chose to use the VM since it&#39;s super cheap anyway, and it&#39;s easier to do the tutorial if everyone&#39;s on the same OS, but you can use the APIs from wherever you like.
silly question but is the virtual machine required to use these Google APIs?
Hi when i am trying to run the code i am getting the following error<br />Kindly let me know where i might have made mistake.<br /><br />google.gax.errors.RetryError: GaxError(Exception occurred in retry method that was not classified as transient, caused by &lt;_Rendezvous of RPC that terminated with (StatusCode.PERMISSION_DENIED, Request had insufficient authentication scopes.)&gt;)
found a solution. first update apt-get with &quot;apt-get update&quot;
hey :-) i tried to install pip on gcloud but i get an error and i dont know what to do.<br />I copied this <a href="https://pastebin.com/Pdyt5n5j">https://pastebin.com/Pdyt5n5j</a> hopefuly you can help me
Happy to share!
Really helpful! Thanks! A lot of the stuff regarding that on Youtube right now is out of date so GREAT THANKSSSS!
Thanks.
I did exactly what you did in the video but I&#39;m getting this error: google.auth.exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError: Could not automatically determine credentials.
Hi thanks for this video.. nice info..<br /><br />I have a query.. I am running google cloud for java. (calling simple compute API to list all the instances). When I execute this from out of my office, it runs properly. But when I execute it from within the company premises, it gives &quot;SSLException error&quot;.<br />So is there any setting if you are aware of to add proxy setting ?
Great to hear! Happy to share em!
Sir, perfect video. Google&#39;s API are quite popular atm but little good tutorials exist on the internet. As Google&#39;s documentation is complete but also very technical, this tutorial is exceptionally handy. Thanks.
omg , I dont mean to be but I am those programmer. I see you used space instead of tab. Sorry, I have no life
this means you haven&#39;t exported your apikey.json. Use the <br />export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/home/*path_to_file*/apikey.json<br />Watch the video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMY0qDg16y4&amp;t=5m19s">5:19</a> on he explains the solution for your problem.
could anyone help me with this error:<br /><br />StatusCode.PERMISSION_DENIED, Request had insufficient authe ntication scopes
that export env var saved my life, much appreciated!

If you guys are working with different os and want to make that GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS work without any incompatibility issue you can do something like this in your program: <br /><br />import os<br />os.environ[&quot;GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS&quot;] = &quot;path_to_your_.json_credential_file&quot;

How do i reconected google cloud printer.<br><br>have been using Cloud Print for a two month with no problem. Occasionally the printer stopped working, so I had to log in and delete it, then add it again. This problem happened today except I can&#39;t add the printer back. As soon as I type in Chrome://devices , Chrome browser crashes and becomes unresponsive. I have re-installed Chrome, restarted all the devices, and even tried with a different computer. It keeps doing the same thing. The printer is not Cloud-ready (it&#39;s a Dymo labelwriter 450).

Google Cloud Platform is amazing but you assume too much. Watching these videos leads down a rabbit hole where I end up researching technologies I don&#39;t need. That&#39;s the only place where Microsoft has you beat. They do a great job walking newbs through the beginning stages.
You should describre the ssl command up in here

Why many other youtuber don&#39;t want to speak about using Google cloud platform.<br />Is any other requirement needed to install Google cloud platform in our website. Or maybe some kind of virtual machine<br />Please bro relay
Hi Suman, thanks for watching our video. Depends on what requirement you are planning to fulfill with the account. The free tier will enable you to set up your own domain. However it will remain only for the period of time that the free tier remains active.
I have to buy domain also ....before using free tier account??

Guys I appreciate the efforts you put on the intros but they are cringe so just stick with normal ones
super short but clear introduction for Django on serverless... but, with a lot of homework on the description (codelabs) 😂
Hi Aaron; when you say &quot;instances&quot; do you mean Cloud SQL or Cloud Run? You can have autoscaling Cloud Run <i>services</i> and autoscaling Cloud SQL <i>instances</i> . There are limits on the maximum number of connections for Cloud SQL which also may affect your setup <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/quotas#postgresql">https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/quotas#postgresql</a>
​@Aaron Free Solutions like pgBouncer or other postgres or mysql specific things may help with the general compounding concurrency issues. More details questions like this are best directed to the google-cloud-run and google-cloud-sql tags on StackOverflow, rather than Youtube comments :)
Hey Katie, thanks for the reply! I forgot that Cloud SQL could auto sale as well, in this case I meant Cloud Run container instances. I may be misunderstanding how Cloud Run works, but my understanding is if you have a service that would traditionally be a Django server on an IaaS setup like Google Compute Engine, you set your service concurrency to 1, and got 1000 requests, Cloud Run would boot up 1000 container instances to handle this traffic, which at least on CloudSQL for PostgreSQL would potentially be over the default max connection limit for even the the most expensive instance database instance type, as it reserves some of its connections for internal ops. Just curious if there’s a good way to deal with this without an unmanaged pgBouncer instance on between.
@Katie McLaughlin Totally, thanks for pointing me in the right direction.
Great video and great work on Cloud Run! It is by far my favorite serverless cloud service. I do have one question though. When using Cloud Run with Django, how would you manage connections for a SQL database? This is something I typically struggle with when modeling a serverless + managed SQL setup, since different spawned instances usually can&#39;t reuse each other&#39;s database connections and spawning too many instances with different connections may be hard for a SQL database to keep up with. I know that Cloud Run instances can serve a limited number of requests greater than 1, but at high(ish) scale I could still see database connection management being an issue.
can you place tell me how can i deploy my running Django project on google cloud console
this is the video which we want
I don&#39;t think there is a one click deploy solution like Google (correct me if I&#39;m wrong) so the tutorial will probably be longer. i&#39;ll put it in my todo list :)

congratulations 🎉
@Red Stapler Thank you.<br /><br />It&#39;s been a while coming, but that gave me time to watch your vids ;)
@Piyush Nichat Thanks man, is still going pretty well ... all working from home now, but is just the times we live in :)
@Piyush Nichat Cool man. Your job is infinitely more important than mine.<br /><br />If I don&#39;t turn up the world carries on regardless, if you don&#39;t turn up the world ends :)<br /><br />Where abouts are you from?
@Piyush Nichat Well, I hope the locust don&#39;t come your way. A lot of pressure on food production in the region ... I&#39;d say it&#39;s looking biblical, but that&#39;s not really your thing down that way heh ;)
I mentioned your channel in a job interview today ... and I got the job ... co-incidence?<br /><br />Yes, but still ... ;)
still free ;) see quoted below from Google<br />&quot;Note: Starting January 1st, 2020, GCP will charge for VM instance external IP addresses. However, under the Free Tier, in-use external IP addresses will be free until you have used a number of hours equal to the total hours in the current month. Free Tier for in-use external IP addresses apply to all instance types (not just f1.micro instances)&quot;
Red Stapler so that means that if we use only 1 VM for 24/7 whole month it is free?
What about paying for external ip from 1st January 2020?
well, there is no such thing as free lunch eh? ;)
What about a domain name for free
the price for vm instance is fixed at monthly rate for sustained use. so the only variable cost is the network which is very cheap unless you have millions monthly visitors and do not cache content. storage isn&#39;t free but free tier quota should be adequate for small/medium websites. (i&#39;m talking about blogs/ static website only)<br /><br />moreover, you&#39;ll have $300 free credit and 1 year time to try out. look at the bill and see what&#39;s the issue. if it doesn&#39;t work for you then you can move out
Try to set up Cloudflare. It slows the site down marginally, but it&#39;s the best protection against DDOS attacks and has loads of other features.

Nice tutorial , how to use domain name instead of ip address !!
My entire pages are not working, showing 404 error.
I can&#39;t make a tutorial on that because it depends on which domain registrar you&#39;re using. (ex. namecheap googledomain godaddy etc.) please refer to their tutorial instead :) <br /><br />simply put. this step is to tell the internet that your <a href="http://www.yourdomain.com/">www.yourdomain.com</a> is at VM&#39;s ip address
I can’t get it to work. Your tutorial is a bit too advanced for a non technical WP user. For example at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UDD-9cPXA8&amp;t=0h05m02s">0:05:02</a> when you say; update the DNS setting to point to the VM instance IP address, I don’t know how to do that :( would be nice to have a tutorial on that too
And free cdn
Set the instance IP address into domain DNS as A records and then simply reset the instance from your GCP and login to ssh again where you&#39;ll be welcome by the questions such as enter your domain name, do you want to issue SSL certificate and all...
agreed
can you write a post to enable SSL, in your video you skipped that part, if you could make a video it will help us.
Hi, good! Alternatively, as hosting I recommend siteground! <a href="https://www.siteground.com/index.htm?afcode=7d201c6c477781be7657418178e4e26b">https://www.siteground.com/index.htm?afcode=7d201c6c477781be7657418178e4e26b</a>
thank you so much for providing such valuable information may god bless you.
it depends on how much &quot;heavy&quot; of each transaction. But I believe you&#39;ll need a full core instant (n1 and up) at least
What machine type do you recommend for a small ecommerce business with less than 100k visitors a month?
NIce tutorial, but I am having a problem while I update the packages in SSH, I can&#39;t get access to my wp-admin and I get the message that the connection is not private and I actually am stuck. <br />I have tried it so many times and I don&#39;t know what to do to go on.<br />Hoping for an answer <br />Thanks in advance
I&#39;m wondering if you can create several instances and then point other domain names to these instances? All from your account? Something like reseller hosting where you host several websites from one account
yeah web hosting is a great option for small website. but eventually if your site grows, you&#39;ll have to move :)
Okay, this is way more complicated than just buying a WebHost. Not worth it for someone like me who just wants simplicity when building websites.
Hello Sir
 <br />I would like to say thank you so much for this great tutorial. I did all of the steps which u taught in the training for running a wordpress bitnami website on googe cloud platform.
 <br />
 <br />But i did all of the steps for wordpress bitnami multisite and i got a problem in one step which is adding a ssl certificates for my seconday domains websites like &quot;<a href="http://blog.hafizawais.com/">blog.hafizawais.com</a>&quot;. My primary wordpress multisite which is &quot;<a href="http://hafizawais.com/">hafizawais.com</a>&quot;got a successful ssl security but the other secondary websites didnt get this ssl certificate. 
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />I would like you to visit my secondary subdomain website &quot;<a href="http://blog.hafizawais.com/">blog.hafizawais.com</a>&quot; and I would be thankful to you if u make a tutorial to how to fix it etc...
 <br />Once again thank you so much for the step by step tutorial
Don&#39;t mind the $ amount, that&#39;s based on preconfigured option. Once you proceed you&#39;ll get to select VM instance again and the price will adjust accordingly.<br /><br /><br />There are always free tier for Cloud services (not just Google) If your website is successful enough you&#39;ll have to upgrade to paid plan eventually (which is good for both you and Google) But if not, this means you&#39;re using only handful resource which is acceptable for them as their marketing cost.
@Red Stapler thanks for your reply, I&#39;ll look further into this.
Just stopped after clicking &quot;Create&quot; on &quot;VIM Instance&quot; (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UDD-9cPXA8&amp;t=1m27s">1:27</a>). After that I noticed on the right handside it said: &quot;$24.67 monthly estimate&quot;. Not sure what they base the estimate on, but somehow I doubt this amazing service will be &quot;free&quot;, at least for very long :) Have a great day.
Do you know if it&#39;s possible to create a mail-account using Google Cloud. Not sure how it would work with this, basically I want people to be able to send a mail to me@<a href="http://mydomain.com/">mydomain.com</a> using this service. <br />Greetings.

You need to buy the domain first at e. g. <a href="http://domains.google/">domains.google</a> if you want to use it instead of the IP
Thanks for the educational video. When I follow this video I&#39;ve got an issue. <br /><br /><br />Your domain: <a href="http://miketestgoogle.co/">miketestgoogle.co</a><br />The domain you put is: <a href="http://miketestgoogle.co/">miketestgoogle.co</a><br />Please verify it is correct. [y/N] y
 <br />Domain has been added into OpenLiteSpeed listener.
 <br />Do you wish to issue a Let&#39;s encrypt certificate for this domain? [y/N] y
 <br /><a href="http://miketestgoogle.co/">miketestgoogle.co</a> is inaccessible, please verify!<br /><br /><br />Do I have to take domain first somewhere? <br />Thanks!
Thank You! This is by far the easiest Google Cloud Platform/WordPress hosting tutorial. It took me 10 minutes and done, the site is up and pointed to my domain. If you are using Google Domains and need to link your Domain to the IP just go to &quot;Website -&gt; Forward to an existing webpage -&gt; Enter IP in the Website URL field -&gt; click Forward&quot;.
White stapler, red background. Lol
This is your daily dose of Red Stapler! 🙃<br />You sound like Daily Dose Of Internet
When I open the SSH, it&#39;s not asking for My Domain. Any ideas?
ja tebja ljublju ,dorogaja!!
Почему все на английском языке,не фига не поняла
change the 1 to an l (a lowercase L)
@Robbie Short thanks bro
Hi Red stapler, the command sudo fallocate -1 1G /swapfile is presenting a issue on my side. <br /><br />I get the following:<br />fallocate: invalid option -- &#39;1&#39;<br />Try &#39;fallocate --help&#39; for more information.
Hello, is it totally free of charge or it requires me to pay some money. thanks ....
thanks
i think u need more ram
is this good enough for an e-commerce website?
not yet. but might post a text version on website.
Easy to understand and follow - many thanks for this TK! Any tutorials on setting up SSL certs and CDN?
It&#39;s still free if you fully use your VM 24/7. Quote from free tier doc:<br /><br /><br />&quot;Google Cloud Free Tier is also available for external IP addresses that are being used by VM instances. In-use external IP addresses are available without additional cost until you have used a number of hours equal to the total hours in the current month. Usage calculations are combined across all in-use external IP addresses. Google Cloud Free Tier for in-use external IP addresses applies to all instance types, not just f1-micro instances.&quot;<br /><br />The external IP was charged on my usage bill but then was deducted under &quot;Spending based discounts&quot;
@Red Stapler Thanks, good to know.
Good ttutorial. What about static IP address, it&#39;s not gonna be free any more (since 1st January 2020), have you tried some workarounds how to manage it for free (any CNAME, etc.)?
Thank you very much ¿, it was a great tutorial
yes
When a site is created on this hosting ... is it acceptable in Google Adsense ??
in my case it does not show goto marketplace
Thanks &lt;3
Quick Question is Cyber Panel included on this 1-Click Install?
you&#39;ll need to register one with domain registrar like <a href="http://name.com/">name.com</a>, google domain, etc. then update dns setting (on their website) to point your domain to your VM IP address. but it&#39;s not going to be free this time.
Red Stapler thank you! It really gives me a lot of insights! I really appreciate it thank you!!
thank you soooo much for the video. it was though to follow for the person like me (perfect beginner :) but I watched it like more than 5 times and I finally made my own site!!! thank you sooo much I really really appriciate it! if there&#39;s anyway I can change my domain name please let me know !! I will watch it over and over :)
worked like a charm, subscribed my dude
thank you so much for this ! super detailed and easy to digest. keep up the awesomeness ! subscribed. thanks again.
it&#39;s a L not a 1
To help with RAM Usage, how did you shift+enter to write a new line of code without it executing? <br /><br />Every attempt at trying to go to the next line when typing in sudo fallocate <del>1 1G /swapfile ends up executing with an error saying fallocate: invalid option -</del> &#39;1&#39;
Awesome content! I really liked the tips for monitoring usage. Thanks!!
Pls, how will I latter apply Encrypt Certificate to my domain? after skipping it in the process. Thanks

This has been a life saver. Thank you so much.
Gr8, simple and straight forward. What&#39;s your opinion running the OpenLiteSpeed stack on docker and f1-micro, will that add any value?
Amazing, super easy to follow!!! Just configured my 1st sitename on GCP!
WARNING FOR STACKDRIVER AGENT - IT IS NOT FREE: I really loved this tutorial and did everything on it. 3 months into my free trial account and I noticed most of my credits were gone. I only had 74usd left from the 300 USD. I had 5 vm&#39;s running on the f1 micro processor at 30GB.This was to be expected. But the real drainer for most of my credits in 3 months was the Stackdriver Agent. It cost me 110ish USD to run for all my VM&#39;s. Install at your own risk, especially if you go into the non-free tier. If you need to uninstall it (I hope this works) run this command on your machine: <br />sudo apt-get purge stackdriver-agent<br /><br />I also removed the google monitor flags from 1 back to 0. If I need to do anything please share with everyone.
Thanks man. It helped me a lot today.
Is there any additional monthly charges that come with using the deployment solutions?
Can you do tutorial on WIX if possible. please and tnx
Very excellent guide, thanks a lot, but why did you skipped the ssl certificate installation?
Is it free?
Help! Does anyone know how to lookup (or setup) the nameservers to point to the new website from my registrar? or do I leave them as default - I&#39;m using GoDaddy
Can this method be used if we already have wordpress website created? And we want to migrate it to Google Cloud?
Very useful and clear to follow. I have gotten my website running in no time. That&#39;s awesome!<br /><br />Just a small share for my situation:<br /><br />1) I have registered my domain via Cloudflare with full SSL on. With A record pointing to the static IP that this tutorial taught; CNAME for www to <a href="http://yourdomain.com/">yourdomain.com</a><br />2) I have not using Let&#39;s encrypt SSL function while first entering the SSH. (Because Cloudflare did it for me).<br />3) I am using putty to logon my SSH (related instruction that you can easily find on GCP related resources)
Leaving this here to make it more easier.... Btw, thx for the tutorial. was effortless to bring it to leave
echo &#39;/swapfile none swap sw 0 0&#39; | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
Hi, Thanks for the tutorial. <br />Does your website still on the same tier from this tutorial ?<br />I used the tutorial for making my website but my site speed not even close to your speed.<br />If you still on the minimalist tier how your website speed is so fast ?

@Ryan Przybyl Thank You Ryan, your explanation was really good and natural with real world scenarios.....(btw, started watching the Google Cloud Network series)
Hey Max! Yeah, this was my first go at presenting to a camera, not something I do often. I agree, it comes across a bit awkward, a learning lesson most definitely. Normally I&#39;m speaking to audiences of people, not newscaster style into a camera!
@Ryan Przybyl what a honest response. You have my respect sir
@Vikas Kumar Thanks, appreciate that!
@Ryan Przybyl great that you had responded and that too with humbleness..
this is hard to digest. Ryan doesn&#39;t look at the camera often, he appears irritated, he is not engaging. a bit awkward. but the host did wonderful and is pleasant.
Hey Suveer, I can make sure you get a copy of the presentation if you want it. Email me at prz@<a href="http://google.com/">google.com</a>, and I can get it to you.
Where can I get a PDF of the presentation?
This was a really good intro to networking on GCP. I&#39;m studying for my first GCP cert (which will be my first cloud cert altogether) and while the Quiklabs and Coursera courses are thorough, they can be a bit dry for someone completely new to networking. I enjoyed this a lot more. Would love to see more OnAir talks for other GCP stuff.
He said a /20, not a /27. You would be right in thinking a /27 would allow for a smaller number of hosts, but in the video since he mentions a /20, that will allow for more hosts than a /24.
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hN-dyOV10c&amp;t=15m39s">15:39</a> in the video, you&#39;re saying that making the 24 in the IP range to 27 will allow adding more VMs . Now, this is CIDR notation, right ? Larger Network IPs will mean smaller number of Host IPs... So <a href="http://10.0.1.0/24">10.0.1.0/24</a> should allow more IPs and hence more VMs than <a href="http://10.0.1.0/27">10.0.1.0/27</a> ... Is that just a miss or am I missing something ?
Am halfway through this video and i couldn&#39;t stop write thanking you and GCP team for creating this wonderful content . This is by far the best quality content i have come across about GCP VPC.
Would be nice to have on the description links to different times in these long videos on the various sections discussed.

Thanks Mandeep
Good for beginners.. 👍👍

Hi Jagdishan, you could opt for Coursera Google cloud platform specialization course. This would have access to labs as wrll. I have myself taken up this course, its not free but worth it. Just take a free trial atleast to checkout yourself.
Hello<br />Is there a end to end Google cloud infrastructure course video with all lab demo ?
dont know if anyone cares but yesterday I hacked my girl friends Instagram account using Instapwn. Just google for it :)
@Kairo Davis Whoa! It took roughly 20 mins but it actually worked!
good video, thunks!<br />I don&#39;t understand, why ara zones needed in dataсenter?

Hi Sourav, an operation is an action that makes changes to or retrieves information about buckets and objects in Cloud Storage. Operations are divided into three categories: Class A, Class B, and free. Hope that solves your query.
While calculating cloud storage, it ask for class A and class B operations. What&#39;s that mean?
really helpful !!
Nice

Amazing tool
Whether it is work offline repair 🙄
Thanks for the request, noted!
Thank you priyanka for the content... kindly do a similar video for terraform.. Looking forward...
I have learned how to use docker and kubernetes this is the way to go. Google has a full suite of services and the support to back it. I will eventually begin using Anthos for Multicloud setup particularly for on premises. Can’t wait to show my work. Thank you all 🙏🏽.
It stores the Kubernetes API objects e.g. YAMLs you apply yourself or others.
@ahmet alp balkan Thanks for the precision!
Hi priyanka. Can you describe what is the purpose of the storage of the K8S master (in the control plane)? Does it store (cache) the container image? Or is it simply the configuration which is stored there?
Pretty useful considering a lot of computers with containers by a lot of developers. It&#39;ll be the biggest helping hand on large scale data management in cloud.
<b>propogate</b>
awesome!
What?!
wow, so easily explained. Thanks a ton Priyanka! Please make more of these 🙏

Am I the only one amazed by the synchronized flow of speech from all the presenters ?
Wow that is really interesting and good to know ANZ has partnered and as well other companies :) , no downtime during their upgrade or any updates. so much flexibility and adaptability and the fast processing is amazing
Does Anthos solutions help reduce ingress and egress costs when there is cross cloud data transfer?
amazing

Can you help me to recover all my data from 2019 up to 2013, because I tried everything already but i still cannot recover in activity log. I don&#39;t know what happen, it&#39;s suddenly disappeared the range from April 2019 downwards to 2013. Please kindly help me to get it in a easy way, because I don&#39;t know how to use those API, ADS and Paltform Domain. Please help me I can give all the details you will need please kindly guide me. Thanks in advance
Excellent
Although Google is a little behind, but they get it... Exciting to see how they close the gap! Most companies know they need to digitally transform and are under pressure to go to the cloud, they just don&#39;t want to botch it. Innovative strategies like industry specific digital transformation solutions, hybrid, and multi-cloud capabilities ease the journey.

Buen contenido. Gracias por compartirlo.
Hola Rodrigo, te recomendamos verificar que la ip sea estática, que estén correctamente configurados los registros DNS, y en el proveedor de dominio están los cuatro nameservers. Saludos
Pietti Design Muchas gracias, se logró finalmente.
Gracias por el video.<br />Seguí las instrucciones paso a paso, pero al finalizar el ingreso de dominio en SSH, el sitio comenzó a caerse constantemente. <br />Me aparece servidor no encontrado, incluso mientras instalo un tema o simplemente no la página. Alguna recomendación?
muito bom obrigado <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Brasil">#Brasil</a>
Hola Frank, debes esperar que las DNS se propaguen este proceso puede demorar hasta 72 horas, sin embargo normalmente es mucho más rápido, puedes también eliminar la caché de DNS en tu computador para que te aparezca el nuevo servidor. Saludos
Saludos y gracias por todos los videos, en esta ocasión realice al pie de la letra todos los pasos sin embargo el dominio me direcciona todavía al antiguo hosting.
Hola, debes esperar que el DNS se propague, y verifica que WP_SITEURL&#39;, &#39;<a href="http://www.dominio.com/">http://www.dominio.com/</a> y WP_HOME&#39;, &#39;<a href="http://www.dominio.com/">http://www.dominio.com/</a> estén bien escritos y en el lugar correcto, recuerda que <a href="http://dominio.com/">dominio.com</a> lo debes cambiar por el nombre de tu dominio. Después de esto debes reiniciar el servidor apache mediante sudo /opt/bitnami/<a href="http://ctlscript.sh/">ctlscript.sh</a> restart apache. También podrías parar la instancia y volverla a iniciar para forzar los cambios. Espero que puedas solucionar el problema. Saludos.
Hola que tal. Ante todo gracias por tus videos, me sirvieron de mucho. Estoy teniendo un problema con este paso y es que ya cambie las DNS en el proveedor de dominios, ahora cuando entro al SSH y cambio esta parte define (&#39;WP_SITEURL&#39;, &#39;<a href="http://www.dominio.com/&#39;);">http://www.dominio.com/&#39;);
 </a><br />define (&#39;WP_HOME&#39;, &#39;<a href="http://www.dominio.com/&#39;)">http://www.dominio.com/&#39;)</a>; y le pongo el nombre de mi pagina, guardo y cierro y la web no toma mi dominio, y otra cosa que me pasa es que en el escritorio de wordpress al refrescar la pagina o tocar algun otro enlace en wordpress (plugins, multimedia, etc) me da para bajar un archivo wp_login.php<br /><br />Me podrias ayudar por favor? hice los pasos tal cual indicaste :(
Hola David, lo ideal en este caso realmente seria utilizar una version Multi sitio de WordPress en el caso de Google Cloud, seria la version de Click to Deploy, ya que la versión de Bitnami para multi sitios no permite otros dominios solo la estructura de sub-dominios. Para tu caso particular, el numero de instalaciones y por el volumen de visitas yo recomendaría otro tipo de hosting como un share o cloud hosting mas económico. Saludos
Hola, muchas gracias por su video, quería saber si me podría responder la siguiente duda:<br /><br />1) Yo tengo 3 dominios/páginas webs en las cuales en su conjunto no superan las 1000 visitas mensuales.<br /><br />2) También tengo 2 dominio/sitio web, los cuales solo llegan a tener 1500 visitas durante tres meses al año y el resto del año no superan en su conjunto las 1000 visitas<br /><br />3) Tengo 1 dominio/sitio web que sí llega a recibir 1000 visitas al mes durante todo año<br /><br />4) Todos estos sitios funcionan en word press, y en cada dominio tengo que instalar tres subdominios para poder instalar versiones diferentes de idiomas de word press (sé que existe el sistema multisitio, pero las traducciones no resultan muy buenas y cuando tengo que manejar idiomas de alfabeto orientales, me provoca muchos problemas gramaticales)<br /><br />En ese caso, al considerar que durante la temporada alta no llego a superar las 4,000 visitas por mes, y que en temporada normal tampoco llego a las 3,000 visitas mensuales, me podría decir si puedo compartir la misma ip y los mismos dns para todos esos sitios?<br /><br />También podría compartir la misma instancia de computer engine para las 18 instalaciones de wordpress que necesito realizar? es que en caso contrario, si por cada instancia debo pagar $14,90 por mes, al final estaría pagando $269 mensuales para sostener un sitio de 3,000 visitas, las cuales no generan ingresos ya que son mayoritariamente sitios informativos?<br /><br />Muchas gracias de antemano por su atención.
Hola Omar debes verificar que efectivamente el cambio de DNS se haya realizado correctamente mediante un ping al dominio y comprobando la IP. Debes verificar que la configuración de la IP estática, configuración DNS este correctamente. Si estos pasos están correctos no deberías tener ningún problema al realizar la migración de tu sitio web, te recomendamos hacer esta migración por medio WP All In One Migration. Saludos.
Hola, excelente video, migre mi sitio de godaddy a google cloud, todo salió bien, pero luego me da este <br />error, &quot;Error establishing a database connection&quot;<br /><br />Tengo una instalación anterior del wordpress en cpanel que vence el 22 de febrero yo migre el 15
 <br /> En cpanel me da este error:
 <br />Location URL

 </a><br />! PHP for the selected domain has failed.
 <br />{installatron} is unable to install to a domain where PHP is not working.
 <br />Your hosting provider can help you resolve this error.
 <br />Error code: 1; HTTP code: 500
 <br />Gracias por su tiempo.
Hola Victor, debes verificar que hayas creado correctamente la zona DNS en Google Cloud, es importante que estén correctos los registros tipo A y el CNAME, después debes comprobar que los NameServers NS estén colocados correctamente en tu cuenta de Godaddy y en el dominio que quieres apuntar a tu instalación de WordPress en GCP. Después de esto no deberías tener ningún problema para acceder a tu dominio. Recuerda que al hacer esto quien administra tus registros DNS es Google Cloud y no Godaddy. Saludos
hello tengo un error cuando trato de acceder a Wordpress no me deja entrar por mi dominio comprado en Godaddy..<br /><br />Este es el error: <br />&quot;No podemos mostrar tu información de DNS porque no administramos tus servidores de nombres.&quot;
Hola Marco, Hostgator ofrece servicios compartidos muy económicos, si se compara con los servicios de VPS de Hostgator puede inclusive salir mas económico Google Cloud. No obstante en cuanto a seguridad e infraestructura y escalabilidad del proyecto sin duda alguna es mejor Google Cloud, que comienza en precios desde los 5 dolares mensuales aproximadamente. Recuerda de todas maneras que a la fecha Google Cloud ofrece 1 año gratis o $300 Dolares por lo cual para el primer año seria mucho mas económico que cualquiera en el mercado. Saludos
@Pietti Muchas gracias por tu respuestas y por compartir tus conocimientos. Voy hacer pruebas con Google Cloud, es que tuve malas pasadas usando GCP en el pasado pero creo que era cuando apenas estaba naciendo GCP. Parece que Google se ha vuelto muy competitivo en el Cloud.
@Marco Zúñiga U. prueba y comparte tu experiencia con nosotros. Saludos
que tal los precios? vs hostgator que cobran una mensualidad?
Me pasó lo mismo de los puntos. Pero allí la agarré de una. Slds!
Hola, si puedes volver a la IP anterior, solo debes eliminar los registros DNS y cambiar el archivo wp-config.php si lo has cambiado. De todas maneras recuerda que debes esperar mientras se propaga la DNS, también te recomendamos verificar correctamente los nombres de servidores, para que apunten correctamente a google cloud, siguiendo estos pasos no debes tener ningún problema al visualizar tu dominio. Saludos
Hola, Se puede volver al ip que tenia anteriormente para acceder al sitio, estaba muy trabajado y ahora no me aparece con mi dominio. GRACIAS
Hola te recomiendo ver el video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KGiAMUCG8o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KGiAMUCG8o</a>, con estos pasos puedes crear tu certificado para WordPress en la version Bitnami.

Hola Bemsson, todos estos servicios son similares, el soporte es bueno y hay una comunidad creciente de usuarios. Respecto a los backups claro que los puedes hacer, próximamente montaremos un video al respecto. Saludos
Excelente @Pietti estaré atento. Muchas gracias por su pronta respuesta.
Hola. Muy buen video. Que tan recomendable es Google Cloud frente a AWS de Amazon y DigitalOcean. Busco algo que me de buen soporte y me premita hacer backups autmáticos (diarios, semanales o cada dos semanas...)
Hola Isaac, debes buscarlo bien en la parte inferior del archivo wp-config.php y ahí tiene que estar. Respecto a las IP debes reservar la IP estática que se explica en el video. Saludos
Hola, espero me puedas ayudar, no me aparece en la consola la parte de: define(‘WP_SITEURL… no sé en dónde cambiarlo. me ayudas? Por otro lado, mi dominio lo tengo en Nominalia y me pide los IP adress. Esos dónde los encuentro? Gracias!
Hola debes ingresar a tu cuenta y buscar DNS, ahí debes poder cambiar los nombres de servidores, en caso de no encontrarlo comunícate con el soporte de InfinityFree. Saludos
Hola, tengo una duda en el paso 4. Configurar los Nombres de Servidores. Yo cree mi dominio utiizando <a href="http://infinityfree.net/">infinityfree.net</a> y no estoy seguro de como agregar o editar los nombre de servidores. Ayuda por favor!
Hola Jonathan, lo puedes dejar así y debe funcionar si cuentas con una IP estática y tienes los registros DNS correctos. También si estas utilizando un certificado SSL puedes simplemente agregarle la S &quot;https://&quot; en el archivo wp-config.php. Saludos
@Pietti Gracias por la respuesta lo que sucede es que en el archivo wp-config.php no se encuentra las siguientes lineas define(&#39;WP_SITEURL&#39;, &#39;http://&#39; . $_SERVER[&#39;HTTP_HOST&#39;] . &#39;/&#39;);
 <br />define(&#39;WP_HOME&#39;, &#39;http://&#39; . $_SERVER[&#39;HTTP_HOST&#39;] . &#39;/&#39;);
Hola Jonathan si es un Multisite no te van aparecer esas lineas pero si algo así: &quot;define( &#39;DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE&#39;, &#39; http://mi-ip.xip.io&#39; );&quot; si es para el certificado puedes agregar la &quot;s&quot;, de todas maneras te recomiendo esta documentación: <a href="https://docs.bitnami.com/aws/apps/wordpress-multisite/configuration/configure-wordpress-multisite/">https://docs.bitnami.com/aws/apps/wordpress-multisite/configuration/configure-wordpress-multisite/</a>.

@Pietti gracias
Hola una consulta como logras cambiar la url para un multisite
Hola Braulio si es posible hacerlo, pero debes configurar correctamente la instancia, en este link puedes encontrar información al respecto: <a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/hosting-multiple-websites-on-single-google-cloud-compute-engine-9768e2f02c6d">https://medium.com/google-cloud/hosting-multiple-websites-on-single-google-cloud-compute-engine-9768e2f02c6d</a>.

Una pregunta, se puede apuntar varios dominios en la misma zona DNS?
Hola, si se maneja por linea de comandos, puedes acceder por ftp (<a href="https://www.onepagezen.com/google-cloud-ftp-filezilla-quick-start/)">https://www.onepagezen.com/google-cloud-ftp-filezilla-quick-start/)</a> y al php my admin (<a href="https://www.onepagezen.com/phpmyadmin-ssh-tunnel/)">https://www.onepagezen.com/phpmyadmin-ssh-tunnel/)</a>. Saludos
Hola! una pregunta, viendo la documentacion puedo darme cuenta no hay un &quot;folder&quot; y un php my admin como para cargar un sitio que ya tengo , todo esto es por líneas de comando , mi pregunta es si así es todo en Google Cloud o solo por ser la instalación de la instancia de Bitnami ?<br /><br /><br /><br />Saludos!
Hola Alejandro, los DNS ese de Google si te permiten poner la prioridad solo debes ponerla antes del registro espacio y luego el valor MX por ejemplo: 1 <a href="http://aspmx.l.google.com/">aspmx.l.google.com</a>, con esto te funciona correctamente. Saludos
@Pietti Fijate que lo hice y no funciono, me decia que el valor era incorrecto, tal cual lo mencias lo hice.
@Pietti Perdon tienes razon, ya vi donde esta mi error, todos los registros se tienen que hacer en el mismo conjunto de registros, yo estaba haciendo uno por registro es por eso que no funcionaba, Saludos
Hola, excelnte tuto! solo que hay un problema si al cambiar los DNS de tu dominio por ejemplo Godaddy y ya tienes registrado los registros MX para que funcione G suite, estos se perderan, google cloud no te permite registrar los MX con prioridad por lo que no funciona, lo mejor es registrar los DNS en godaddy y solo apuntar el dominio a la IP, de ahi en fuera todo lo demas excelente tuto.
Hola Agustin, te recomiendo ver los errores log en WordPress en Google Cloud, o realizar el proceso nuevamente, recuerda que lo primero es seleccionar la IP estática, despues crear los registros DNS correctos A y CNAME, y por ultimo también debes cambiar la URL de WordPress en el archivo wp-config.php dependiendo si utilizas el stack de Bitnami. Saludos
Hola <br />Muy ueno el video sin embargo tengo un problema realize todo tal cual y donde me deja de funcionar es cuando pongo mi dominio en google nada me sale la pagina pero simple como si fuese solo en html y cuando trato de poner el wp-admin me sale el 410 gone nginx cuestion no puedo hacer nada.
Hola Anabel, debes tener instalado o creada una instancia antes de que te muestre una IP, una vez creada la instancia debes ir a VPC Network &gt; External IP Address y ahí seleccionas Reserve Static Address, le asignas un nombre y listo. Recuerda que para esta version gratuita solo te permite una IP estática. Saludos
Cuando ingreso a ser estatico el IP , no me muestra nunguna IP. Puedes apoyarme en eso.<br />Saludos!!!
Hola Edson, espero que hayas podido solucionar el problema, recuerda que los DNS según el proveedor de dominio pueden demorar mas o menos tiempo en propagarse, si no te deja definitivamente cambiar los servidores comunícate con el soporte de Hostgator para que te solucionen el problema. Para los dominios te recomiendo que utilices <a href="http://namecheap.com/">namecheap.com</a>. Saludos
Cierto, gracias mi sitio web ya está activo.
Hola qué tal, compré mi dominio en hostgator pero cuando lado los ns no los agrega y realice en googlecloud lo que realizaste en el video
@Pietti con el Google Click Deploy que tendriamos que poner en el ssh? excelente sus videos gracias por las respuestas
Hola Ismael, si instalaste el stack de WordPress Bitnami en Google Cloud este comando debe funcionar sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/wp-config.php. De lo contrario muy probablemente tienes instalado otro stack de WordPress por ejemplo Google Click Deploy. Saludos
@Pietti Hola gracias por tu respuesta, si tenia instalado otro, tuve que eliminar e instalar el de Bitnami, una pregunta muy aparte, como se activa el envió de correo, probé recuperando contraseña por medio de correo y me sale que mi servidor tiene deshabilitada esa opción. tienes algún tutorial para eso? de ante mano, muchas gracias... Saludos y bendiciones.
@Jose Orestes para editar el archivo wp-config.php en la Version de Google Deploy debes colocar sudo nano /var/www/html/wp-config.php. Sin embargo la URL en el caso de WordPress Google Deploy se puede cambiar directamente en el escritorio de WordPress. Saludos
@J. Ismael Briones Lezama debes utilizar un plugin en tu WordPress para el envió por SMTP, uno es el WP Mail SMTP otro puede ser el Zoho, tenemos un tutorial de como configurar correos corporativos utilizando Zoho Mail: <a href="https://youtu.be/lD1GKad1bBE">https://youtu.be/lD1GKad1bBE</a>.

Hola Jaime, si te pide una IP prueba con colocar la IP estática que se asigna en GCP. En tu consola de Google Cloud &gt; VPC Network &gt; External IP Address. Saludos
Hola, lo primero es decirte que es un excelente tutorial, muy bien explicado y completo, por otra parte tengo una pregunta: tengo mi dominio con nominalia y cuando voy a cambiar los nameservers me pide una ip y la verdad no se que ip debe ir allí, te agradezco cualquier ayuda que me puedas dar; muchas gracias!
Hola lo importante es que en el Canonical name pongas tu nombre de dominio sin las www y ahí no debes tener ningún problema, también recuerda que solo debe haber un registro CNAME. Saludos
Hola, tengo un problema y es que en la parte del registro CNAME no me permite crearlo, si le pongo www donde dice Nombre de DNS me da el siguiente error (Un nombre puede tener un conjunto de registros de recursos CNAME o conjuntos de registros de recursos de otros tipos, pero no ambos) y si intento hacer el registro cname se queda guardando pero no hace nada? que podrá ser?
Hola, tuve el mismo problema, pero debes activar el botón en la parte superior derecha en la &quot;Send Key Shortcut&quot;,luego aparece una ventana, en la cual debe seleccionar &quot;ctrl key&quot; y luego colocar &quot;X&quot; en la barra en blanco, dar click en &quot;Send Keys&quot;, finalmente debe aparecer la opción de guardar cambio con &quot;Y&quot; y por ultimo &quot;Enter&quot;. Espero que sea de gran ayuda. Saludos.
Hola en este caso debes utilizar Cmd + X. Saludos
¡Hola! En mac no me sirve el ctrl + X No me quiere salvar, ¿Qué puedo hacer?
Muy bueno tutorial, fuciona si lo sigue al pie de la letra, solo hace falta el path que hay que realizar en cloud para ingresar al compute engine donde se instalo wp y usario y contraseña para el paso final. Si lo pueden compartir se les agradece.
Hola debes seguir los pasos, recuerda que lo mejor es que tengas una IP estática, crees la zona DNS, configures correctamente los registros A y CNAME, y en GoDaddy coloques correctamente los 4 nombre de servidores de google (nameservers), después de verificar todo esto es cuestión de que se propague la DNS, en algunos casos demora un poco mas. Saludos
He seguido los pasos pero no reconoce mi dominio godadfy con el hosting de google cloud
Hola Christian, hay varias opciones para hacerlo uno es utilizar la version Multisitio de WordPress. Sin embargo si quieres que cada dominio este separado entonces deberías utilizar Apache Virtual Host o Using protocol forwarding. Mira este link: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34570063/hosting-multiple-websites-in-google-compute-engine">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34570063/hosting-multiple-websites-in-google-compute-engine</a>. Saludos
Puedo en un sola VM de google Cloud subir varios sitios WP de distintos dominios ?
Hola Eduardo, si puedes acceder a la raíz del servidor de varias formas SSH, FTP. No obstante con WordPress Bitnami o Click to Deploy en Google Cloud el proceso de instalar por fuera de la raíz no está disponible en proceso de instalación, para poder lograr esto tendrías que crear una instancia e instalar todo lo necesario para tener WordPress. Ahora cuando instalas WordPress utilizando Bitnami o Click to Deploy, se instala en la IP asignada para la VM Instance, podrías trabajar el sitio en esa IP, y apuntar el dominio cuando esté lista y aprobada por el cliente. Próximamente montaremos un tutorial sobre como acceder por FTP pero te recomiendo que veas este link por lo pronto (<a href="https://www.onepagezen.com/google-cloud-ftp-filezilla-quick-start/)">https://www.onepagezen.com/google-cloud-ftp-filezilla-quick-start/)</a>. Referente a los correos estos simplemente los configuras en la zona DNS que creaste a través de los registros MX recuerda que estos registros deben ingresarse primero la prioridad espacio y después el valor. Por defecto Google Cloud tiene deshabilitado el envío de correos por php mail, por lo cual para que tus correos desde el sitio web funcione debes instalar un plugin como WP SMTP Mail o Zoho Mail si utilizas la plataforma de Zoho. Saludos
@Pietti Muchas gracias por las respuestas.<br />Estamos implementado bitnami para el sitio. Una consulta, con respecto a la conexion FTP, hicimos los pasos del link de referencia, pero al conectarnos no nos permite subir, modificar ni crear archivos, por medio de FIlezila.<br />Tendremos que hacer alguna habilitación más?
@eduardo venegas te recomiendo que mires este articulo (<a href="https://www.onepagezen.com/fix-ftp-permission-errors-google-cloud/)">https://www.onepagezen.com/fix-ftp-permission-errors-google-cloud/)</a> sobre todo en los comentarios, ya que los pasos que muestra este articulo solo te sirve para archivos específicos y se hace muy tedioso de manejar, pero en los comentarios te dan la forma de agregar un usuario que pueda controlar todo. Los pasos en Bitnami serian mediante SSH: &quot;sudo adduser www-data
 &quot; y despues &quot;sudo chown -R username:www-data /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/&quot;. Saludos
Muchas gracias, muy claros los tutoriales, te hago un par de consultas.<br />Es la primera vez que vamos a instalar un Wp con Woocommers en google Cloud a pedido de un clientes.<br />La instalación del Wp se puede realizar en una carpeta dentro del servidor. <br />Por ej <a href="http://dominio.com/wp">dominio.com/wp</a> y cuando este el listo el sitio recién ahí publicarlo para que levante el sitio desde la raíz,<br />Dejando todo los archivos referentes al wp dentro de la carpeta, y solo sacando el index a la raiz, es la forma habitual en la que normalmente realizamos las implemetaciones de WP en servidores/hosting comunes.<br />No sabemos si con el google Cloud podemos acceder a una raiz del servidor para poder modificar luego la ubicación del index y demás. <br />Una vez delegado los DNS y teniendo el Wp en funcionamiento se puede acceder via Ftp?<br />Por otro lado, como se maneja el tema de casillas de correo ligadas al dominio asiganado. Me podrias orientar
Hola Anubis, que pena en la demora de la respuesta espero que hayas podido solucionar, y nos comentes como lo hiciste. De todas maneras yo seguiría estos pasos, primero identificar los errores accediendo al log de Apache mediante SSH mediante &quot;sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache2/logs/error_log&quot;. Después si identifico que por ejemplo es un plugin podría desactivarlos accediendo a la base de datos mediante SSH Tunnel te recomiendo este link: <a href="https://www.onepagezen.com/phpmyadmin-ssh-tunnel/">https://www.onepagezen.com/phpmyadmin-ssh-tunnel/</a>. Saludos
Hola si, logré solucionarlo. El asunto era que cuando reinicias la VM debes activar los servicios. Pero también se activa el apache2 por defecto. La solución era desactivar el apache2 para que no haga conflicto con el apache que publica el wordpress. La solución fue ejecutar un comando :)
@ANUBIS TACTICAL STORE super me alegra. Comparte el comando tal vez le pueda servir a alguien. Saludos

Hola, muchas gracias por los tutoriales, tengo una duda. ¿Como puedo hacer un subdominio en Cloud Google? Gracias, espero su respuesta :)
Hola Simon puedes colocar la IP estática de tu instancia, es la misma que utilizaste al crear el Registro A en el cloud DNS. Saludos
hola, ahora en godaddy tambien te pide una direccion ip por cada servidor de nombre donde la puedo encontrar?
Hola Julian si instalaste la version de WordPress Bitnami estas lineas deben aparecer en el archivo wp-config.php. De todas maneras puedes redireccionar el dominio editando el archivo bitnami.conf mediante el siguiente comando &quot;sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache2/conf/bitnami/bitnami.conf&quot;. Recuerda que para que funcione correctamente debes tener una IP estática y haber creado y configurado correctamente los registros DNS, A y CNAME. Saludos
@Pietti Hola Rafael muy amable muchas gracias por responder.<br /><br /><br />Ingrese para editar el archivo bitnami.conf y curiosamente no aparecen lineas para editar el dominio, verifique y si tengo la IP estatica y los registros DNS, A y CNAME estan bien.<br />Al escribir el dominio en el explorador me direcciona a mi IP con terminacion .<a href="http://xip.io/">xip.io</a>. <br />Otro detalle es la version de Bitnami Wordpress Multisite 5.3-0<br />Que recomendacion me puede dar? <br />Muchas gracias de nuevo!
@Julian Rodriguez en ese archivo debes colocar las lineas tu. Sin embargo al ser un Multisitio te recomiendo que leas estos articulos: &quot;<a href="https://docs.bitnami.com/aws/apps/wordpress-multisite/configuration/configure-wordpress-multisite/">https://docs.bitnami.com/aws/apps/wordpress-multisite/configuration/configure-wordpress-multisite/</a>&quot; y &quot;<a href="https://docs.bitnami.com/aws/apps/wordpress-multisite/configuration/configure-wordpress-multisite/#add-several-wordpress-multisite-blogs-with-different-domains%22">https://docs.bitnami.com/aws/apps/wordpress-multisite/configuration/configure-wordpress-multisite/#add-several-wordpress-multisite-blogs-with-different-domains&quot;</a>.

@Pietti Que tal Rafael muchas gracias por tus sugerencias he podido redireccionar el dominio es bastante interesante el proceso agradezco tu ayuda.<br /><br /><br />Saludos!
Hola muy buen aporte tengo un comentario y dos preguntas.<br /><br /><br />He seguido los pasos y todo bien hasta que llegue a editar el wp-config.php<br />Al buscar las siguientes lineas <br />define(&#39;WP_SITEURL&#39;, &#39;http://&#39; . $_SERVER[&#39;HTTP_HOST&#39;] . &#39;/&#39;);<br />define(&#39;WP_HOME&#39;, &#39;http://&#39; . $_SERVER[&#39;HTTP_HOST&#39;] . &#39;/&#39;);<br />no aparecen por que las escribi manualmente, al ingresar en le explorador mi dominio abre pero muestra la IP y no el nombre de dominio.<br />Que pudo haber sucedido que no aparecen las anteriores lineas?<br />Existe alguna manera de corregir el problema?<br /><br /><br />Muchas gracias espero su respuesta.
Hola es para WordPress Bitnami u otro tipo de instalación?
Hola Raefael, segui tus pasos pero a la hora de hacer la conexión SSH no me aparece la misma configuración , no se si fue porque compre los dominios en Google Dominios
Hola William para solucionarlo prueba entrando tu instancia mediante SHH, utilizas el comando &quot;sudo -i&quot; y luego reinicias Apache mediante &quot;sudo /opt/bitnami/<a href="http://ctlscript.sh/">ctlscript.sh</a> restart apache&quot; si después de esto sigue sin funcionar debes detener la instancia y después reiniciarla nuevamente en Google Cloud. Adicional,mente este comando te servirá para ver el estatus de tu base de datos &quot;sudo /opt/bitnami/<a href="http://ctlscript.sh/">ctlscript.sh</a> status&quot;. Saludos
@Pietti Hice todo y sigue igual :( Al ejecutar &quot;sudo /opt/bitnami/<a href="http://ctlscript.sh/">ctlscript.sh</a> status&quot; no me muestra nada
@William Angel y si tienes instalado WordPress Bitnami u otra instalación. Saludos
@Pietti si, bitami siguiendo los pasos de tu video
@William Angel debería aparecerte la información, te recomiendo reiniciar el proceso con una nueva instancia. Saludos
Hola, gracias por el tutorial, Una vez apunto el dominio al server, me da el error &quot;Error establishing a database connection&quot; de wordpress
La infraestructura de Google Cloud es mas flexible y robusta, pero su costo es mayor. Ahora en este momento Google Cloud ofrece $300 dolares o 12 meses de servicio gratis. Saludos
Hola amigo. Muy bien tus videos. ¿Qué servicio es mejor y conviene más, Google Cloud o SiteGround?
Muy útil muchas gracias!
Me pasa igual, como puedo resolverlo?
Hola Juan lo importante es que pongas los nombre de servidores correctos que te proporciona Google Cloud recuerda que son 4. En GoDaddy es fácil vuelve a entrar al dominio y verifica que el cambio este correcto. Recuerda de todas maneras que este proceso puede demorar algún tiempo para que se propaguen los DNS. Saludos
@Adonis Tejeda recuerda poner los 4 nombres de servidores y guardar los cambios. Este proceso puede demorar algún tiempo. Saludos
Hola!! Excelente tutorial. Primero encontré tu blog y está genial👌<br />Tengo un problema cuando agrego los mame servers en godaddy y le doy guardar me aparece una página blanca y no pasa nada ningún aviso ni nada.<br />Quizá he cometido un error podrías ayudarme?

buenas tardes , el tutorial esta exelente , tengo un problema compre un dominio <a href="http://www.isaroses.com.ec/">www.isaroses.com.ec</a> pero sigo todos los pasos pero no puedo acceder a wordpress , como me pueden ayudar
Hola Ana, si el objetivo es el mismo que cuando configuras un dominio para apuntar a un hosting, sin embargo el procedimiento es diferente en Google Cloud, por que tenemos que tener una VM Instance, habilitar y configurar el cloud DNS. Respecto a un constructor de paginas podrías buscar en el Marketplace cual puede ajustarse a tu proyecto. Saludos
@Pietti okis gracias👍 feliz día, sería bueno un tutorial sobre ello.
Muchas gracias x compartir, quisiera saber si esto es lo mismo configurar dominio con el hosting pero en este caso con Google cloud? Y si es así.. hay la opción de tener un constructor de página en lugar de WordPress?
Muchas gracias Vale! hoy logre montar mi página en tiempo récord gracias a tu orientación :) Dios te siga bendiciendo
Hola Jhonni, debes configurar los DNS con los registros MX de Google, y para WordPress debes instalar el plugin WP Mail SMTP by WPForms, para que envié los correos desde WordPress. Saludos

para configurar los dominios pero para un multisite es los mismos pasos?
Hola puedes instalar el Theme que quieras y no deberías tener ningún problema, recuerda siempre utilizar Themes de buena calidad y que estén siempre actualizados. Saludos
Excelente el tutorial! consulta después puedo instalar el theme que yo quiera sin problema? o me recomendas intalar otro tipo de wordpress?
@Pietti estoy usando la version de bitmani, cuando copio esto: sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/wp-config.php me dice que la fila no existe
@Pietti la version de bitnami que estoy usando dice wordpress bitnami and automatic.
@Pietti debo comenzar el proceso de cero correcto.?? De ante mano, gracias por responder. Me estoy guiando de tus tutoriales para montar mi primer sitio web. compre un dominio economico . xyz y estoy usando hosting de google.
Estimado, espero no molestarlo, hice el proceso igual al tutorial y aun me sale el error htdocs Does not exist
Hola Esteban, si estas utilizando la version de Bitnami te deben aparecer estas lineas. Saludos
@Shalom Desings revisa los pasos del tutorial puedes ver el articulo de blog en este link: <a href="https://pietti.com/como-configurar-dominios-wordpress-google-cloud/">https://pietti.com/como-configurar-dominios-wordpress-google-cloud/</a>. Si utilizas este comando en el lugar correcto no tendrás ningún problema y no debe aparecer este mensaje que comentas. Saludos
@Shalom Desings si recientemente le agregaron la parte de Automatic por que viene preinstaldo con algunos plugins de esa empresa como Jetpack, sin embargo los puedes eliminar si no los necesitas una ves instalado tu WordPress. Saludos
@Shalom Desings debes estar colocando el comando mal escrito o con algún error por favor revisa el tutorial en nuestra web para que sea mas fácil hacerlo: <a href="https://pietti.com/como-configurar-dominios-wordpress-google-cloud/">https://pietti.com/como-configurar-dominios-wordpress-google-cloud/</a>.

Hola.. Gracias por el Tutorial, solo tengo un inconveniente, no me aparece <br />define(&#39;WP_SITEURL&#39;, &#39;http://&#39; . $_SERVER[&#39;HTTP_HOST&#39;] . &#39;/&#39;);<br />define(&#39;WP_HOME&#39;, &#39;http://&#39; . $_SERVER[&#39;HTTP_HOST&#39;] . &#39;/&#39;);<br /><br /><br />para cambiarlos en el SSH, favor tu orientación
@Pietti Yo que tengo multisitio y que no ocupo multisitio... comenté las siguientes líneas del wp-config.php:<br /><br />*/<br />define(&#39;WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE&#39;, true);
 <br />define( &#39;MULTISITE&#39;, true );
 <br />define( &#39;SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL&#39;, false );
 <br />$base = &#39;/&#39;;
 <br />define( &#39;DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE&#39;, &#39;www.mywebsite.co.uk&#39; );
 <br />define( &#39;PATH_CURRENT_SITE&#39;, &#39;/&#39; );
 <br />define( &#39;SITE_ID_CURRENT_SITE&#39;, 1 );
 <br />define( &#39;BLOG_ID_CURRENT_SITE&#39;, 1 );<br />/*<br /><br />y así se resolvió el problema.
Necesitaría poder ver o cambiar el password de my SQL?, realmente ya no se que hacer.
@Tomas Diz si quieres ingresar a la base de datos te recomiendo ver este tutorial: <a href="https://youtu.be/80T9WKXe3tg">https://youtu.be/80T9WKXe3tg</a>. Saludos
Buenas noches, realicé todos los pasos correctamente a mi modo de ver (los repetí 3 veces desde el comienzo), siguiendo estos mismos tutoriales pude migrar un sitio, pero con este proyecto que es para una pagina web de mi hermana no puedo ingresar al wordpress. Alguna sugerencia?.
Hola Johan, puedes enviarme el dominio que estas intentando configurar. Saludos
Llevo días pero no puedo configurar el dominio en Cloud, entro a mi página y aparece que no se puede acceder verifiqué todo y está correcto, me podrías apoyar, saludos.
Hola si los pasos los seguiste no debes tener problemas. Ahora recuerda que se debe propagar los DNS, y puede que haya algunas intermitencias en los servicios por la coyuntura actual. Debes verificar que puedas acceder directamente a la pagina sin ningún problema. Saludos
@Pietti Hola, Muchas gracias. Error de novato. Había cambiado los DNS por los cloudflare y no se habían propagado

Hola muchas gracias por el video!!!!!!!!!! Exitos...
Hola Mariano, los pasos para configurar los dominios son diferentes, te recomiendo ver la documentación oficial, o este link también te puede servir: <a href="https://www.siteyaar.com/google-cloud-wordpress-multisite/">https://www.siteyaar.com/google-cloud-wordpress-multisite/</a>. Saludos
@Pietti Gracias ahora voy a ver si puedo lograrlo!!! buen fin de semana...
Hola Rafael buenas tardes!!! Gracias por tu aporte. Hice todo al pie de la letra, pero lo ultimo de la consola no sale. Yo genere un Bitnami Multisite en Wordpress. Tenes idea como debo hacer lo ultimo??? Muchas gracias. Saludos. Mariano
Hola, te cobrara a partir del año de servicio o cuando agotes los $300 dolares de crédito, lo que suceda primero, y antes de esto te notificara que ha expirado tu prueba gratuita. Saludos
pero para todo esto a Google Cloud. se le tiene que pagar? Durante el periodo de prueba gratuito, Google no te cobrará nada sin tu permiso. entonces la pregunta es desde cuando te cobrara google?
Hola Janet, debes borrar la cache y esperar que los DNS se propaguen. Y nuevamente podrás acceder, este proceso puede demorar unas horas. Saludos
Que pasa si ya no me permite entrar a esa pagina inicial donde se ingresa a wordpress, me aparece este error DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN
Hola la debes cambiar en wp-config.php mediante el comando &quot;sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/wp-config.php&quot; recuerda que previamente tienes que haber asignado la IP estática y configurado correctamente los DNS, y haber apuntado el dominio a los nombres de servidores de GCP. Revisa este paso: <a href="https://pietti.com/como-configurar-dominios-wordpress-google-cloud/#editar-url-wordpress-google-cloud">https://pietti.com/como-configurar-dominios-wordpress-google-cloud/#editar-url-wordpress-google-cloud</a>.

Pietti OK, muchas gracias Crack.
Hola me puedes ayudar con esto por favor en mi ADMIN <b>WP</b> no viene mi direccion del dominio web si no la IP y no me deja modificara, cual son los pasos para lograr modificar que aparezca mi diminio. Muchas Gracias siempre por tus videotutoriales <b>eres el mejor</b>
Hola debes configurar un correo para que envié la información por SMTP, este plugin te puede servir: &quot;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/%22">https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/&quot;</a>. En este video te mostramos por ejemplo como hacerlo con Zoho Mail: <a href="https://youtu.be/lD1GKad1bBE">https://youtu.be/lD1GKad1bBE</a>. Al recibir el correo es mas fácil identificar el problema. De todas maneras si te da error el Theme deberías tal vez investigar si es incompatible con algún plugin previamente instalado. Saludos
Buenas noches Rafael estoy teniendo este problema con Ha habido un error crítico en su sitio web. <b>Verifique la bandeja de entrada de correo electrónico del administrador de su sitio para obtener instrucciones.
  Obtenga más información sobre la depuración en WordPress</b> y no soy de resolver el problema, esto me paso tras instalar una plantilla para woocommerce. Un saludo y Gracias
Muchas gracias, me ayudó en los comentarios que agregas que el utilizar WP Mail SMTP by WPForms sirve para configurar fácilmente el correo G Suite en GCP.
Hola Alvaro recuerda poner la ruta correcta para ingresar a wp-config.php en el caso de una instalacion de Bitnami es &quot;sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/wp-config.php&quot;. Saludos
tengo no puedo ingresar para editar wp-config.php<br />la pantalla de la consola queda negra y no puedo editar
Claro que si. Saludos
Brother, muchas gracias! esto ha sido maravilloso, movi mi proyecto a Google Cloud y esta super rapido, es una maravilla.. Pana eres muy generoso me alegra haberte conocido por aca.. yo tengo un canal de negocios, ojala podamos colaborar, cuidate.
Hola Gonzalo, lo puedes cambiar sin ningún problema te recomendamos ver el siguiente video: <a href="https://youtu.be/RnMpc5ofOm0">https://youtu.be/RnMpc5ofOm0</a>. Saludos
@Pietti Graciass! muy utiles los videos ,muy explicativos se aprende mucho jaja
hola que tal ? muy buenos tutoriales ,gracias ! me quedo una duda ,va en realidad es un error mio ,me puse a editar la web antes de cambiar el dominio y ahora necesitaria cambiar el dominio,se puede sin problema ? o se genera algún inconveniente ?desde ya gracias !!
Hola Diego, cambiarlo? o transferirlo a Google Domains? Saludos
Cambiarlo, es decir, tengo un dominio registrado y funcionando en cloud. Quiero seguir utilizando ese mismo sitio, solo que con otro dominio que tengo.
@Julieta Rodriguez si lo puedes hacer solo debes configurar la IP la Zona DNS y migrar la instalación que tienes en el otro dominio te recomiendo ver este articulo en nuestro blog: <a href="https://pietti.com/como-migrar-wordpress-all-in-one-wp-migration/">https://pietti.com/como-migrar-wordpress-all-in-one-wp-migration/</a>. Saludos
Lo reviso muchas gracias.
@Pietti Listo, ya lo revise y por lo que entendi necesitaria tener otro sitio web ?........ Puedo tener dos sitios web desde google cloud ? ...
@Julieta Rodriguez si claro puedes tener tantos sitios como requieras, eso si debes crear otra instalación de WordPress es decir otra instancia en Google Cloud. Si quieres aprovechar la oferta actual de $300 dolares o 12 meses, te recomendaría crearla con una nueva cuenta. Saludos
Buen dia pietti, quiero cambiar el dominio de mi sitio web en google cloud. De casualidad sabes como puedo hacerlo ?
Hola, seguí su consejo de esperar, pero después de un rato, dejó de funcionar, sin haberle movido nada.
Hola Julian, te recomendaría que contactaras con el soporte de Godaddy para que te dieran asistencia sobre este problema, de todas maneras recuerda que los cambios de nombres de servidores toman algún tiempo en reflejarse. Saludos
Hola como estas , segui el tutorial de principio a fin y mira que en godaddy cuando le das en change para cambiar los nameservers te aparecen dos opciones (default y custom), a mi no me aparecen, simplemente me muestra los campos de texto para ingresar los nombres de los servidores, yo copio los 4 y los pego y le doy guardar pero no me guarda los cambios, ya que cuando reviso me vuelve a mostrar los servidores de godaddy, sabes que puede ser? te lo agradecería mucho.
Muito ogrigado bro..!!!!!! me salvaste...lo ingrese como 5 veces..hasta que lei que no habia que colocar los ultimos puntos en Godaddy..!!!! : ]
Amigos al momento de copiar los servidores de google tengan en cuenta que no lleva punto al final, así es como esta en google <a href="http://ns-cloud-b1.googledomains.com/">ns-cloud-b1.googledomains.com</a>. y así es como debería quedar en godaddy <a href="http://ns-cloud-b1.googledomains.com/">ns-cloud-b1.googledomains.com</a><br />Otra cosa, aproximadamente 30 minutos se demoró después de que realice este tutorial en mostrar mi pagina en el navegador, no se preocupen por el mensaje de pagina no encontrada.<br />Exitos chicos
@Pietti Saludos! Muchas gracias. En donde encuentro los registros MX?
Hola Gonzalo, donde registraste el nombre de tu dominio debes tener la posibilidad de editar los registros DNS, ahí modificas los Nameservers y colocas los 4 que te da Google Cloud, y en la Zona DNS de Google Cloud agregas los 4 registros MX para que tu dominio siga funcionando con G-Suite. Saludos
si yo tengo mi dominio en g suit como agrego los dns en el proveedor de dominio?
Hola revisa que las lineas que cambiaste estén correctas, reinicia Apache mediante el siguiente comando &quot;sudo /opt/bitnami/<a href="http://ctlscript.sh/">ctlscript.sh</a> restart apache&quot; y recuerda que antes debiste configurar una IP estática y la Zona DNS en Google Cloud, y en el registrador de dominio debes colocar los 4 Nameservers proporcionados por Google y esperar que se propague la DNS. Saludos
Hola Rafael excelente video super explicado y a detalle, tengo un par de inconvenientes: despues de conectarme a mi instancia via ssh - segui todos los pasos cambie los dos lineas, reemplace y grabe pero me envia a una pagina que dice que no puedo acceder a este sitio. Que debo hacer? ayudeme por favor. Gracias
Hola Miguel, a que te refieres exactamente con paginas dinámicas?. Saludos
Hola me gusta mucho este canal, quisiera saber sin ¿se puede configurar igual para paginas dinamicas?
Gracias me alegra que te haya servido. Saludos
Buenas tardes, excelente este tutorial. Aplica igual para MOODLE sobre todo al final en el SSH?
Hola Ruben, lo que veo es que la URL que colocas no esta apuntando a los servidores de Google. De todas formas esta es la documentación oficial: <a href="https://bitnami.com/stack/wordpress-multisite">https://bitnami.com/stack/wordpress-multisite</a>. Saludos
Hola! Estoy siguiendo los tutoriales, solo que tengo un wp-multisitio de bitnami, y una vez q asigne el nombre de dominio, ya no puedo entrar al wp_admin, me dice que la pagina me ha redirigido varias veces .....<a href="http://midominio.com.ar/wp-signup.php?new=midominio.com.ar">midominio.com.ar/wp-signup.php?new=midominio.com.ar</a>, me podrás dar una guia para seguir?
Hola Diego, simplemente los tutoriales iniciales se hicieron con WordPress Bitnami, cada imagen tiene sus propias características pero no existe mayor diferencia entre una u otras. Saludos
​@Pietti muchas gracias me encanto su canal, espero ver mas videos , voy a darle click en toda la publicidad de google ads , de verdad muchas gracias
Una pregunta , que tiene de especial bitnami en comparación a otras ? O aún sin bitnami
Hola Diego, esta es la documentación oficial: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/cdn/docs/using-cdn">https://cloud.google.com/cdn/docs/using-cdn</a>. Es relativamente fácil. Saludos
buenos días , estuve buscando en sus videos como habilitar la CDN de google , es fácil de hacer ???
Hola, dominios para comprar gratis no conozco realmente, sin embargo con cupones un .com lo puedes encontrar desde 5 dolares a veces un poco menos, busca los cupones o promociones de descuento para la compra de dominios. Te recomiendo que adquieras un dominio pago que no tenga publicidad ni nada que pueda afectar tu proyecto. Saludos
Hola. Una pregunta..una pagina donde comprar dominio gratis? No tengo dinero para comprarlo. Tengo mi sitio que estoy montando en google cloud
Hola Daniel, te recomiendo ver este tutorial ahí te explican como hacerlo: <a href="https://onepagezen.com/cloudflare-cdn-wordpress-google-cloud/">https://onepagezen.com/cloudflare-cdn-wordpress-google-cloud/</a>. Saludos
@Pietti Perfecto, ya estoy siguiendo el tutorial, pero ya yo tenia cloudflare en mi sitio web, yo migré mi página wordpress a google cloud siguiendo toda su lista de reproducción, e hice todo lo del vídeo ya, mi pregunta es si nuevamente tengo que colocar los nameserver en mi proveedor de hosting otra vez? osea sería básicamente colocar todo como estaba, así mismo es? o tengo que cerrar mi sitio web de cloudflare y hacer los pasos nuevamente, ahí es donde me pierdo? gracias por favor espero tu respuesta
@Pietti Listo hermano, ya solucioné haciendo lo que mencioné, eliminar mi sitio de cloudflare y volverlo añadir, luego añadi los nameserver de cloudflare a mi proveedor de dominio y listo, pero! ahora solo tengo el problema de que teniendo activado el SSL mi página se ve mal, se rompe un poco, (cuando quitó el ssl pues vuelve a la normalidad) que puede estar pasando? por favor necesito ayuda si puedes responderme pronto! mi sitio tiene muchas visitas y esto me esta siendo perjudicial!
@Daniel Galindo Bg me alegra que ya te haya funcionado, cual es tu pagina?
@Pietti <a href="http://endagapa.com/">endagapa.com</a> igual sigue sin agarrar el certificado en full, y cuando coloco Full (strict)
 <br />me sale error 526 de cloudflare :(((
​@Daniel Galindo Bg si lo colocas en Full (strict) es por que tienes instalado en Google Cloud un certificado SSL, de lo contrario debes poner la opción Full. Acabo de probar tu pagina y me ingreso sin problemas, puede ser que demore algo en propagarse el DNS. Saludos
@Pietti ¿Serías capaz de ingresar a mi sitio web y decirme que podría estar pasando? algunos links apuntan a la ip estatica y no a mi dominio!
@Daniel Galindo Bg lo que observo es que tienes contenido mixto en tu web, tal vez por que migraste primero el sitio antes de instalar el certificado SSL o enlazar el dominio. Debes reiniciar los enlaces permanentes. Y luego identificar que recursos se están cargando desde URL sin &quot;HTTPS&quot;. Saludos
@Pietti Perfecto comenzaré desde el principio y lo haré tal cual el orden, pero me gustaría saber si queriendo agregar las DNS de cloudflare debería de omitir algún paso de sus vídeos o no? Gracias por favor respóndame esta última pregunta
@Daniel Galindo Bg no es necesario que comiences desde cero, lo único que yo haría seria subir el respaldo que tenia antes y con esto todas las URL quedan con &quot;HTTPS&quot; una vez subido me aseguro que la URL funcionen correctamente simplemente reiniciando la estructura de URL en WordPress en la opción Ajustes &gt; Enlaces permanentes. Saludos
@Pietti Suscrito de verdad excelente maestro, una pequeña duda, si quiero mantener los subdirectorios como podría hacer? all in one migration lo puede hacer? digo porque tengo mi página con WordPress y adicionalmente tengo otro WordPress en un subdirectorio... que método verías adecuado para migrar todo y con subdirectorios?? ¡Espero esa respuesta por fa!
@Daniel Galindo Bg en este caso te tocaría hacerlo manualmente por que el plugin solo te sirve para tu WordPress actual donde estas sacando el respaldo. En este caso te toca subir tanto archivos como bases de datos en el servidor. Saludos
Hermanazo ya hice todo el procedimiento y perfecto, pero me gustaría saber como hacer para añadirle las dns de cloudflare, ayuda por fa!
Hola, lo tendré en cuenta, por lo pronto te puedo decir que lo puedes configurar con una nueva instancia y configurando correctamente los DNS para esta nueva instancia la instalación sea un subdominio de tu dominio principal. Saludos
Mi amigo Muchas Gracias por tus contenidos... son espectaculares!!... Podrías hacer un vídeo de como hacer un SUBDOMINIO en Google cloud por favor... Seria Genial... Gracias !!!
muchas gracias seguí tus 2 totorales y ahora tengo word Press!!!
Hola Angel si el proceso es diferente para el stack de WordPress Multisite, por ejemplo este por configuración solo acepta subdominios, no dominios diferentes. Esta es la documentación oficial: <a href="https://docs.bitnami.com/google/apps/wordpress-multisite/">https://docs.bitnami.com/google/apps/wordpress-multisite/</a>. Si buscas tener varios dominios deberías utilizar el stack de Wordpress Multisite Click to Deploy, aquí hay una guía sobre esto: <a href="https://www.siteyaar.com/google-cloud-wordpress-multisite/">https://www.siteyaar.com/google-cloud-wordpress-multisite/</a>.

Hola 
 Pietti excelente aporte me a servido mucho . pero e tratado de hacer los mismo al momento de instalar wordpress multisite by bitmani y funciona totalmente diferente al momento de confugurarlo agradecería mucho si pudieras darme una guía , llevo agun tiempo buscando y aun no e encontrado nada. GRACIAS
Hola Jose, puedes saltarte este paso ya que aplica para WordPress Bitnami y probar si te funciona correctamente, el comando de Moodle Bitnami seria &quot;sudo nano installdir/apps/moodle/htdocs/config.php&quot; modificas las lineas solo si es necesario y después reinicias Apache mediante el siguiente comando &quot;sudo installdir/<a href="http://ctlscript.sh/">ctlscript.sh</a> restart apache&quot; este comando solo aplica para el stack de Moodle Bitnami, aquí esta la documentación oficial: <a href="https://docs.bitnami.com/installer/apps/moodle/configuration/change-url-prefix/">https://docs.bitnami.com/installer/apps/moodle/configuration/change-url-prefix/</a>.

@Pietti Gracias Pietti
Hola Pietti, y para Moodle como seria, lo que pasa es que yo instale Moodle, y me quede en la parte de sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/wp-config.php de ahi no avanzo..... 😎
Hola debes esperar que se propague correctamente los DNS. Saludos
hola, hice todo, pero voy a entrar a mi pagina y aparece que no esta, que hago? ayuda plis
Hola Juan este dependerá de la configuración que utilices al crear tu VM Instance, puede comenzar en 5 dolares mensuales, y el limite en gasto dependerá de la configuración de la instancia, cuando creas la instancia Google Cloud te da un estimado de gasto mensual según la configuración elegida. Saludos
Muy bueno el video , pregunta cuanto seria el gasto por mes si paso los 12 meses ?. Por usar worprees más una base de datos , !. Y alojar mi dominio ?
Hola Sara si es posible en el Cloud DNS crear una nueva zona o utilizar la existente y mediante la IP crear el subdominio. Saludos
Saludos desde Costa Rica. Es posible crear y posteriormente agregar un subdominio en la Zona DNS de GCP, y como decirle donde apunte. Saludos
Hola debes configurar la salida de correo por SMTP, puede ser mediante el WP Mail SMTP by WPForms, o puedes ver nuestro video de Zoho Mail <a href="https://youtu.be/lD1GKad1bBE">https://youtu.be/lD1GKad1bBE</a>. Saludos
Seguí los pasos Salio Genial, pero salio un PROBLEMA ahora resulta que no puedo recibir correos en mi bandeja que me Falta configurar...

Como puedo conectarme por via ssh a la base de datos Mysql?
Hola Leo, a mi la pagina me aparece y verificando los DNS están apuntando correctamente a Google Cloud. Lo que observo es que aparece este error &quot;Error establishing a database connection&quot;, este puede ser causado por varios factores uno de ellos haber editado los datos mal del archivo wp-config.php otro que es muy común es que el disco de la VM Instance se haya llenado, para verificar esto puedes ingresar por SSH, accedes como root con el comando &quot;sudo -i&quot; y luego colocas el comando &quot;df -h&quot; para ver el uso del disco, si esta lleno lo primero que te recomiendo es que detengas la VM Instancia, después dentro de Compute Engine &gt; Disk selecciones el disco correspondiente a tu instancia y das clic, después haces clic en el botón de editar y ahí aumentas es el tamaño del disco y clic en guardar, una vez hecho vas a iniciar nuevamente tu VM Instance e ingresas nuevamente por SSH y vas a dar los siguientes comandos &quot;sudo -i&quot;, &quot;sudo growpart /dev/sda 1&quot;, &quot;sudo resize2fs /dev/sda1&quot; y por ultimo reinicias apache &quot;sudo /opt/bitnami/<a href="http://ctlscript.sh/">ctlscript.sh</a> restart apache&quot; (Este ultimo comando aplica solo para la versison de WordPress Bitnami). Espero te sirva. Saludos
gracias por compartir , nesectio tu ayuda creo que la heliado en ssh , por que no encuentro exactamente el mismo codigo que te aparece, igual lo cambie varias veces pero me dice que la pagina no existe <a href="http://ibizashirt-z.com/">ibizashirt-z.com</a>
Hola Leo, te respondí en el anterior comentario verifica y me cuentas si te funciono. Saludos
@Pietti Hey gracias por tu respuesta tan rapida y con. buena vibra , bien hice exxactamente loq ue me comantaste pero , nada , igualmente tengo un back up del wp entero . lo que hice es borrar la instancia , volvere mañana mas fresco a realizar el tuto desde cero :)
@Leandro Mar observo que instalaste la version de WordPress Multisite? es la que que necesitas? Saludos
@Pietti Gracias de nuevo por respuesta , en principio tenia la idea recreativa solo para motivar el conocimiento y aprender ( amo ser autodidacta) , y como ya venia hace un tiempo trabajando con vm creadas en GCloud ,diseñadas para renderizar ediciones para projectos colaborativos sin animo de lucro . y al ver a amigos / pareja , pagando shopify o wp de pago , me dije ok vamos a probar con montarme yo mismo un WP y comprar un dominio por gdaddy y ver que pasa... la version es la de bitnami , igualmente como decia antes , ya elimine la instancia y empezare de cero ;) ... vamos al lio
YES ! salio ya esta todo perfeto es verdad , al agregar la pp the wp nome fije que era la multisite ;) gracias mil gracias seguimos en contacto , lo bueno del canal que es real time doing !
lo logre ! , pero aun falta rellenar el sample site , con ocntenido , tenia la index pero creo qeu la borre se puede restaurar el diseño original de default para asi poder agregar neuva mente un theme y verlo . gracias sigo cada video desde ayer
@Leandro Mar me alegra que lo hayas logrado. Sobre el contenido inicial de WordPress simplemente es un articulo de blog que se llama &quot;Hello World&quot; y dos paginas una que se llama Sample Page y Privacy Policy, como tal la pagina de Sample Page solo tiene texto falso, por lo cual no tiene mucho sentido restaurarla. Simplemente crea tus nuevas paginas o entradas a medida que le vayas colocando el contenido a tu sitio web. Saludos
@Pietti si es verdad !! ya est aoslucionado , lo nio ahora es que si coloco e dominio <a href="http://www.ibiashirt-z.com/">www.ibiashirt-z.com</a> , no me da , pero si con <a href="http://ibizashirt-z.com/">ibizashirt-z.com</a> que sera que por ssh consifure mal el codigo ?
@Leandro Mar yo lo veo bien, lo que veo es que el primer dominio que pones esta mal escrito o son dos diferentes? Si pongo el segundo sale bien y si le coloco www. redirige a la version sin www que es lo correcto por temas de SEO. Saludos
no puedo tio , creo qeu edite mal los comando y ahora no se como volver atras o restaurarlo ... alguien ??
Hola Angie debes habilitar y configurar el Cloud DNS y colocar los registros MX de acuerdo a tus servicios Google. Saludos
Hola, ¿Cómo puedo conectar el dominio sin perder mis servicios de Gmail?
Puede ser que el error se genera al estar en cloudflare?
Hola Ezekiel si tienes una instalación de WordPress Bitnami debes colocar la redireccion mediante el comando &quot;sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apache2/conf/bitnami/bitnami.conf&quot; te recomiendo ver este tutorial sobre SSL: <a href="https://pietti.com/certificado-ssl-gratis-wordpress-google-cloud/">https://pietti.com/certificado-ssl-gratis-wordpress-google-cloud/</a>. Saludos
No deberías tener ningún error, recuerda que si tienes instalado el certificado SSL en tu dominio y la maquina virtual debes en Cloudflare CDN en la sección de Crypto, seleccionar Full (Strict). Y debes esperar que se propague la DNS. Saludos
@Pietti GRACIASSSS! Tal vez aparecen en resultados de búsqueda el ip y también el mismo contenido con el dominio... en google por solo tener el sll de cloudflare... voy a hacer lo que me decís de instalar uno dentro de bitnami y luego full en cloudflare...! a ver si e redirecciona a las personas que entran desde http://34.106.2..... y no desde el dominio! (lastima que ya hay publicado pare del sitio en google con el ip! solo habia hecho lo de gestionar el dominio en google cloud y en config de wordpress! abrazooo y GRACIASSS!
lo hiceeee y funciono geniooooo! redirecciona el ip al dominio! ahora siempre veran todo con el dominio y sera cuestion de tiempo que no marque google contenido duplicado! mil gracias!
Hola GENIOOOOO! (Me sirvieron y son muy entendibles tus tutos!) solo tengo una pregunta... el dominio entra perfecto! pero tambien el ip... poniendo el ip entras a la pagina y no redirecciona... y en google aparece el resultado tanto con el ip como con el dominio... tengo que hacer algo referente? meterle algún redireccionamiento o algo para que quien ponga el ip vaya directamente al dominio, o que no aparezca el ip en google, ya que creo que tomara como contenido duplicado! agradezco que me puedas tirar un tips! no tengo idea que hacer! :S GRACIAS
Hola Guillermo, me alegra en Google Domains demora un poco mas en propagar la DNS. Saludos
excelente tutorial gracias por tu aporte, lo acabo de hacer, vamos a ver cuanto tarda en funcionar, mi dominio esta en google domains.! <br />saludos hermano:!
excelente explicacion muchas gracias, no sabes como me ayudo, saludos
Hola, estas instalando WordPress, que tipo de Stack es Bitnami? Saludos
@Pietti si usé bitnami, seguí este video y el de wordpress cn google cloud
@Romina krumm lo primero que tienes que hacer es revisar el archivo wp-config.php mediante el comando &quot;sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/wp-config.php&quot; y verificar que estas las lineas correspondan &quot;define (&#39;WP_HOME&#39;, &#39;https://www.sanitizapronto.cl&#39;);
 <br />define (&#39;WP_SITEURL&#39;, &#39;https://www.sanitizapronto.cl&#39;); das &quot;Ctrl + X&quot; para salir y luego &quot;Y&quot; para guardar. Me confirmas si te funciona. Saludos
Hola, pucha he hecho todo lo que dices y me sale error 500 te adjunto la página <a href="http://www.sanitizapronto.cl/">www.sanitizapronto.cl</a>
Hola la documentación de la version de Bitnami WordPress Multisite la encuentras aquí: <a href="https://docs.bitnami.com/google/apps/wordpress-multisite/configuration/configure-wordpress-multisite/">https://docs.bitnami.com/google/apps/wordpress-multisite/configuration/configure-wordpress-multisite/</a> , ten en cuenta que solo permite subdominios y no dominios adicionales. Saludos
@Pietti Muchísimas gracias por el aporte!
Excelente explicación, te seguí hasta lo último pero mi wordpress bitnami es multisitio y quedé en dudas donde cambiar y agregar los dominios personalizados. Te agradezco si me das na mano, veo que eres muy entendido en el tema...
Hola Deisy, debes volver a conectar por SSH y revisar el archivo wp-config.php mediante el comando &quot;sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/wp-config.php&quot;, en nuestro blog esta explicado el paso a paso en este articulo: <a href="https://pietti.com/certificado-ssl-gratis-wordpress-google-cloud/">https://pietti.com/certificado-ssl-gratis-wordpress-google-cloud/</a>. Saludos
Hice todos los paso por despues de editar la URL en la pantalla negra..ok CONTRL + X Y para guardar.. pero luego no se como salir de esa pantalla y cierro la ventana me dice que no se guardarán los cambios... y al intentar ingresar a la web me da error 404 así que creo que no ha quedado configurada- ¿cómo puedo hacer? ya revise todos los pasos anterior y la IP, los DNS todo está correcto
Hola Deisy, debes crear en el Zona DNS, los registros MX, TXT, A o CNAME, o cualquier otro tipo de registro que necesites, y que previamente tenias configurado en tu dominio. Este video muestra el proceso para por ejemplo crear correos corporativos gratis con Zoho mail y como se editan los registros MX, tal vez te pueda servir de guía: <a href="https://youtu.be/lD1GKad1bBE?t=423">https://youtu.be/lD1GKad1bBE?t=423</a>. Debes tener en cuenta que por ejemplo en los registros MX se coloca primero la prioridad y luego el destino, y en los registros TXT el valor debe ir entre comillas. Saludos
@Pietti Muchas gracias por tu ayuda y grandisimo aporte!! gracias
Otra pregunta cuando cambio los nameserves me aparece que: Toda la configuración del dominio (incluidos los sitios web, el correo electrónico, los registros sintéticos y los registros de recursos) se encuentra inhabilitada. esto quiere decir que el correo corporativo de ese dominio ya no se puede usar? tienes algún tutorial sobre esto. estoy usando un dominio de google domains
Hola, pero tienes un nombre de dominio o no? si tienes un nombre de dominio simplemente es reservar la IP estática, habilitar el Cloud DNS y crear los registros A y CNAME después en tu dominio colocas los 4 Nameservers proporcionados por Google y esperas que se propague la DNS, y podrás ingresar por tu nombre de dominio. Saludos
Se puede crear un proveedor de dominio? como sería? necesito ayuda :( soy estudiante y tengo una wm en google cloud con una pagina web, puedo ingresar a ella mediante su IP fija de google, pero necesito poder ingresar a ella mediante el ingreso de un url como www.urlasignada.local , pero no puedo usar los servicios de Godaddy, alguna idea?
Hola John, solo deberías agregarle la S al &quot;http&quot; para que quede &quot;https&quot;. Saludos
genial el video, me ayudaste un monton, pero tengo una duda, si tengo un wordpress multisitio, debo realizar la misma configuracion del archivo wp-config?
Hola Samuel no hay que comprar los servicios en GoDaddy, simplemente es un ejemplo de donde tenia el dominio en ese momento, personalmente si quieres comprar el Dominio te recomiendo <a href="http://namecheap.com/">Namecheap.com</a> los dominios son a menor precio y el servicio es muy bueno. Saludos
hay que comprar los servicios de godaddy ?
disculpa, al momento que acabaste de configurar todo, en que tiempo pudiste acceder mediante el nombre de dominio a la pagina?
Hola Kelly si no instalaste Bitnami WordPress tal vez la ruta de tu archivo wp-config.php es diferente prueba con este comando &quot;sudo nano /var/www/html/wp-config.php&quot;, ahora si no es una instalación de Bitnami WordPress la URL la puedes cambiar directamente en tu escritorio de WordPress en Ajustes &gt; Generales revisa este articulo: <a href="https://pietti.com/como-configurar-dominios-wordpress-google-cloud/#editar-url-wordpress-google-cloud">https://pietti.com/como-configurar-dominios-wordpress-google-cloud/#editar-url-wordpress-google-cloud</a>. Saludos
No sé que hice mal, pero mi instancia no es la bitnami... cuando voy al paso de abrir ssh cambiar lo del archivo wp-config no me lleva a ninguna parte... ayuda!
Hola en Google Cloud, puedes tener en una misma instancia los dominios que necesites, podrías por ejemplo instalar LAMP y configurarlo, la velocidad en general de Google Cloud es mejor que la de un hosting compartido, y por lo general mas económico si lo comparas con VPS, la próxima semana estaremos montando un curso sobre como hacer estas configuraciones. Saludos
@Pietti Muchas gracias por responder y tan rápido. Eres la primera persona que veo que hace eso, y por eso te estoy muy agradecido. Solo una ultima pregunta. Vi en uno de tus videos que escogias por decirlo así un plan que valia x cantidad de dolares. Entiendo que Google Cloud no te cobra por todo un año, pero al año siguiente te va a cobrar por ese plan que elegiste o le puedes hacer un up-grade? Basicamente te pregunto esto por cuanto yo deseo instalar unas 10 webs aproximadamente y como no conozco de aspectos técnicos, no sabría exactamente que plan escoger. Esa es mi principal duda. Escoger un plan que de pronto me quedo corto, o escoger un plan demasiado holgado para mis necesidades? Muchas gracias de nuevo y con esto ya no te interrumpo mas. Saludos a la distancia...
Hola, después de el año o cuando agotes los $300 dolares, es cuando Google Cloud va a generar una facturación, para tu caso lo mas optimo es una instalación en LAMP con una sola instancia, y la configuración la puedes cambiar a medida que lo necesites. La otra semana estaremos montando un curso sobre este tema que puede servirte. Saludos
Buenos dias desde Ecuador. En primer lugar, muchas gracias por tus excelentes videos de ayuda. Tengo una pregunta por favor. Si yo deseo instalar dominios ilimitados (bueno, serian unos 10 en realidad) para que funciones esas 10 webs, se puede hacer? El precio que Google Cloud va a cobrar es igual que un hosting compartido que esta mas o menos en unos 10 dolares mensuales? Y con respecto a la rapidez en cargar las webs, Google Cloud es mas rapido, o depende del sitio geográfico en que las coloquemos? Muchas gracias por tu gentil respuesta.. Manuel González.
Hola ingresaste al archivo colocando sudo primero para garantizar que puedas escribir el archivo, puedes también utilizar el teclado que esta en la parte superior derecha para ejecutar el comando. Saludos
No debes usar Command x, se utiliza control x, me pasó lo mismo :)
Hola, en el nano cuando le doy Command x(Mac) no me aparece la opción de guardado solo me dice (help Mode disable). Qué podría hacer para solucionarlo, ya que me quedé atorada en esa parte del tutorial
Hola Ernesto, si debes cambiar los nombres de servidores a personalizados e ingresar los 4 Nameservers proporcionados en el Cloud DNS de Google. Saludos
Pietti gracias por tomarte el tiempo de responder y tan pronto. De verdad me has ayudado mucho! Saludos! Has ganado un leal seguidor! 😎👍🏽
Genial tutorial. Que pasa si en lugar de GoDaddy mi proveedor es el mismo Google? Tengo que entrar al Google Admin y ahí ingresar los nombres y demás? Hay algún tutorial de eso? Gracias por la ayuda.
Hola los cambios de DNS en el dominio con los nuevos Nameservers pueden demorar un tiempo en propagarse. Realiza un ping a tu dominio a ver si esta apuntando a la IP correcta. Saludos
Estoy que tiró mi PC por la ventana.... No me sale no sé que estoy haciendo mal... Mi pregunta es si los cambio del dominio se ven inmediatamente o hay que esperar a que se actualize o descargue?
Hola Nestor me alegra que estés interesado en crear tu sitio, aprenderás mucho y sera divertido. Para tu caso particular te servirá la estructura que ya haz hecho, las imágenes y los textos, pero debes cargarlo todo en una instalación nueva de WordPress. Saludos
Hola <br />Estoy diseñando mi propio sitio web a punta de tutoriales <br />Inicialmente estaba trabajando con google sites y ya monte varias paginas a mi dominio pagado <br />Pero no me gusto gogle site porque sale un mensaje de reportar abuso ademas de que cuando comparto el sitio sale que es de google site y su logo <br />Ahora quiero pasarme a wordpress y mi pregunta es:<br />Tengo que desmontar o Puedo pasar tolo lo que antes habia construido?<br />Me toca empezar de cero?<br />Gracias <br />Esto de crear mi propio sitio <br />Es muy entretenido
Hola Lucas si puedes hacerlo mediante el plugin All-In-One WP Migration en este video se muestra como hacer el proceso: <a href="https://youtu.be/RnMpc5ofOm0">https://youtu.be/RnMpc5ofOm0</a>. Tambien existe una forma para paginas de bajo trafico de que el servicio siempre sea gratis en Google Cloud, estaremos montando un curso sobre esto. Saludos
Muchisimas gracias! Ganaron un Sus.! Un consulta: de aca a un año cuando se me venza el plazo, en el caso de no tener para pagar el host. Puedo importar todo y llevarlo a otro host mas economico?
Hola Lucas este error normalmente sucede por alguna configuración errónea en el servidor, revisa el Cloud DNS y comprueba que el valor correspondiente a la IP este correcto, así como el CNAME, después de comprobar esto debes ir a tu registrador de dominios y comprobar que los 4 Nameservers proporcionados por Google en la zona DNS estén correctos en nombre de tu dominio que quieres apuntar a Google Cloud, otra verificación que puedes hacer es realizar un ping al dominio para comprobar a que IP esta resolviendo, otra posible causa es el uso de un VPN, si es asi desactivalo y vuelve a ingresar. Otra razon podria ser algun plugin, para esto lo recomendable seria desactivarlos todos por phpMyAdmin y luego ir activando uno por uno y comprobando que todo este correcto. Saludos
@Pietti Muchas gracias por responder! Me fije en los dns y el ip y esta bien, no se como hacer el ping ni como entrar a phpmyadmin. Disculpa por tantas consultas es que no encuentro informacion por ningun lado y no quiero perder el proyecto
@Lucas Neuman puedes escribir a través de <a href="https://pietti.com/contactenos/">https://pietti.com/contactenos/</a>, y con gusto trato de ayudarte. Saludos
@Pietti Que grande! Mil gracias
@Pietti Hola queria avisar que ya lo puede solucionar, lo que hice fue pausar y reanudar el VM tal como si apagara y prendiera el router. Gracias!
@Lucas Neuman me alegra. Saludos
Hola! Una consulta, ya hice todos los pasos y tengo mi sitio andando pero me salto un error 504, el proveedor de dominio no salta error, en Wordpress no se porque no puedo acceder y en Cloud me guió poco y nada, revise los DNS pero parecen estar bien, Que puede ser? Agradecería mucho una respuesta
Hola Mario puedes acceder mediante SSH, en tu instancia hay un botón en la parte derecha con este nombre. Normalmente la ruta para acceder es en el caso de Bitnami WordPress &quot;cd /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs&quot; en el caso de otro tipo de instalaciones la ruta puede ser &quot;cd /var/www/html&quot; cd es el comando para cambiar de directorio, también te puedes conectar por SFTP aquí en este articulo se explica como hacerlo: <a href="https://pietti.com/como-acceder-por-ftp-a-google-cloud-con-filezilla/">https://pietti.com/como-acceder-por-ftp-a-google-cloud-con-filezilla/</a>.

Hola, tengo un problema, al parecer por una imagen que subi mi sitio ya no carga, usualmente usaba hostgator en donde entraba a un cpanel y podia ver las carpetas y borrar lo que me generara conflicto pero aca no se como acceder a todo ese contenido me puedes ayudar?? gracias
Hola Andres, debes configurar los registros MX en el zona DNS del Cloud DNS, normalmente esos registros para Google G Suite son: <br />10 <a href="http://aspmx.l.google.com/">aspmx.l.google.com</a><br />20 <a href="http://alt1.aspmx.l.google.com/">alt1.aspmx.l.google.com</a><br />20 <a href="http://alt2.aspmx.l.google.com/">alt2.aspmx.l.google.com</a><br />30 <a href="http://aspmx2.googlemail.com/">aspmx2.googlemail.com</a><br />40 <a href="http://aspmx3.googlemail.com/">aspmx3.googlemail.com</a><br />40 <a href="http://aspmx4.googlemail.com/">aspmx4.googlemail.com</a><br />50 <a href="http://aspmx5.googlemail.com/">aspmx5.googlemail.com</a><br />Recuerda que cuando los crees debes agregar cada uno en un item, la prioridad va primero y luego espacio y el destino. Saludos
@Pietti muchisimas gracias eres el mejor!!!
AUXILIO! Todo salió perfecto pero yo ese dominio lo tenia configurado los correos corporativos con gsuite desde la época que eran gratis y ya no puedo recibir ni enviar mensajes de las cuentas creadas. Por favor ayuda!
Hola lo que observo es que los DNS no se han propagado, cuando hago un ping al dominio que colocaste en el comentario anterior no se encuentra el host, recuerda que el cambio lo debes hacer en el registrador de dominio y debes colocar los 4 Nameservers que te proporciona Google, adicionalmente en la Zona del Cloud DNS de Google debes crear los registros A y CNAME, y debes esperar que se propaguen los registros DNS, en algunos casos este puede demorar un par de horas. Saludos
Hola, esta exlente. Lo aplique con goddary y me funciono pero en hostihger no, cuando cambio el dominio entrando por SSH se daña el wordpress ya no me permite entrar al administrador, solo una pagina de Hostinger que muestra &quot;This domain name is parked FREE, courtesy of Hostinger.&quot; el dominio es @t. Ayuda. Gracias de antemano
Que maravilla! gracias
Hola revisa que hayas reservado la IP estática y en el cloud DNS el registro A este correctamente la IP y el registro CNAME, en tu proveedor de dominio revisa que este apuntando a los 4 nombres de servidores proporcionados por Google Cloud, si todo esto esta correcto puede ser simplemente que tengas que esperar que se propague la DNS, en el algunos casos toma algún tiempo. Saludos
@Pietti cuando cambio el defined dentro del servidor hasta el template del wordpress me muestra con fallas, solo si uso el Ip estatico para ver la pagina, porque con el dominio me dice que no se encuentra el DNS :( podria enviarle capturas si puediera darme una ayuda :(
@Wakai Asia si quieres escríbeme a través de la pagina para responderte y poder ayudarte <a href="https://pietti.com/contactenos/">https://pietti.com/contactenos/</a>. Saludos
@Pietti disculpe podria ayudarme profesor?, intente configurarlo pero no me reconoce y me manda el siguiente error No se pudo encontrar la dirección IP del servidor.
 <br />Intenta ejecutar el Diagnóstico de red de Windows.
 <br />DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN<br /><br />Le agradeceria si pudiera ayudarme porfavor, no se como solucionarlo :(
Hola Martin debes seguir los pasos del tutorial recuerda que debes configurar una IP Estática, crea una Zona en el Cloud DNS, crear los registros A y CNAME, en el registro A debe ir la IP estática, y en tu registrador de dominio deben ir los 4 Nameservers proporcionados por Google, y debes esperar que se propague la DNS. Saludos
@Pietti Si el dominio lo tengo registrado en Google, son necesarios todos los pasos o sólo con colocar el registro A que apunte a la IP? Gracias de antemano.
@Juan Suarez a mi me gusta cambiarle los nombres de servidores si estos no son los mismos, y seguir los demás pasos. Pero también puedes solo apuntar a la IP también es valido. Saludos
Hola! Segui los pasos pero me tira &quot;This page isn´t working&quot; &quot;dominio&quot; didn´t send any data
Hola si tienes instalado WordPress el archivo wp-config.php debe existir, prueba con esta ruta &quot;sudo nano /var/www/html/wp-config.php&quot; o prueba ingresando al html y ver que encuentras con los siguientes comandos &quot;cd /var/www/html&quot; y después &quot;ls&quot;. Los comandos los pongo entre comillas para que los identifiques mas fácil pero los comandos no incluyen las comillas, y el ultimo comando es ele ese. Saludos
Exelente el video gracias, tengo una pregunta, no tengo la misma version de Wordpress instalada en Google cloud, por tanto me da error de archivo no encontrado, pero al tratar de buscar el archivo no mr da ningun resultado, es como si los comando no sirvieran pero no me da mensags de error, soy nuevo con Google cloud, podrias ayudarme en eso, quiero encontrar la ruta del archivo &quot;wp-config.php&quot;.gracias
Hola la diferencia es que si no reservas una IP estática en teoría esta puede cambiar y cuando lo haga el registro A que colocaste en la zona del Cloud DNS de Google Cloud, va a apuntar a una IP que no es valida y tu sitio web se va a dejar de mostrar, tendrías que manualmente actualizar este registro. Saludos
Cual es la diferencia o ventaja adquiriendo la IP estatica, porque yo lo hice sin la IP estatica y me funciono
Hola Isidro para hacer esto debes generar un Snapshot después restaurarlo en otra zona y la IP estática la apuntas a esta nueva instancia y listo. En esta lección que hace parte del Curso de WordPress Google Cloud se muestra como hacer el snapshot: <a href="https://pietti.com/curso/wordpress-google-cloud/leccion/crear-snapshot-o-backups-automaticos-google-cloud/">https://pietti.com/curso/wordpress-google-cloud/leccion/crear-snapshot-o-backups-automaticos-google-cloud/</a>. El curso cuenta con un canal exclusivo de soporte, por si te sirve. Saludos
@Pietti gracias por su rapida respuesta. se refiere a reservar una nueva ip estatica? si es así esta tiene un coste adicional, no es asi?
@Isidro Míguez Silva no necesariamente debes reservar una nueva IP estática, cuando restauras el snapshot en la region que quieres cambias la IP estática que tienes actualmente a la nueva instancia, lo otro seria liberar la IP anterior lo cual ya no te genera costos, y reservar la IP nueva. Saludos
@Pietti voy a intentarlo, espero no liarla. jeje gracias amigo. si tengo alguna duda le digo.
@Isidro Míguez Silva en español se llama Capturas y sigue los pasos de la lección de acceso libre que te coloque en link. Saludos
@Isidro Míguez Silva puedes hacerlo de las dos formas yo normalmente la creo en la misma region y después al restaurarlo escojo otra region. Saludos
@Pietti ya tengo restaurado el snapshot en una nueva instancia, ahora solo necesito saber si es tan amable, como asigno la IP del proyecto y si puedo borrar la instancia antigua. gracias
@Isidro Míguez Silva puedes en VPC Network &gt; External IP Address le das cambiar y la asignas a la nueva instancia, antes de borrar la anterior te recomiendo que revises bien que todo este correcto. Saludos
@Pietti nada...cuando le doy a cambiar (una vez he pasado de efimera a estática), no me deja reescribir la IP, sale atenuado en gris ese espacio mostrando la ip nueva
@Isidro Míguez Silva puede ser que tengas que esperar o por el cambio de region no te deje, en ese caso seria que le reservaras una IP estática nueva y se la asignaras y después borras al anterior. Saludos
@Pietti no permite asignar IP ni aun reservando una nueva dirección estática, me doy por vencido, o algo no estoy haciendo bien o debe haber otro metodo ademas del que me explicó usted para cambiar de region
@Isidro Míguez Silva según la documentación oficial es uno de los dos métodos disponibles, existe otro por medio API, revisa la documentación oficial: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/moving-instance-across-zones">https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/moving-instance-across-zones</a>. Saludos
hola buenas noches. Por error a la hora de asignar dominio a mi web, usando google cloud, he cambiado sin querer la región de la IP estática, (ahora aparece us-west2-c), estoy en europa, por lo que ahora va superlento y ni siquiera carga cuando lo intento desde un celular. No quiero arruinar cerca de un mes de trabajo, por lo que le pido ayuda si fuese tan amable de decirme como cambiar a la región europe west2-a sin reservar una nueva dirección estática. Muchísimas gracias de antemano.
Hola Carlos, para salir y guardar del editor nano debes presionar &quot;Ctrl + X&quot; luego &quot;Y&quot; para guardar y después Enter para salir. Saludos
¿Qué tecla o comando para cerrar la pantalla sin perder el cambio?
Hola debes crear en Cloud DNS tu zona correspondiente a el nombre de tu dominio, en los registros MX que son los que permiten enviar y recibir correos debes colocar primero la prioridad y después el valor para G-Suite por ejemplo un valor seria: &quot;5 <a href="http://alt12.aspmx.l.google.com/">alt12.aspmx.l.google.com</a>&quot;. Saludos
​@Pietti me mata que respondas!! sos el Nº1.<br />los que me estas diciendo es que en g cloud añada estos registros:(?)
@Laboratorio Spotorno si correcto debes agregar los registros MX en Google Cloud. Saludos
hola master! hice todo el tutorial. el dominio lo compre en google Domains y tengo G Suite. cambiando las dns pierdo la recepcion de correos de info@<a href="http://midominio.com/">midominio.com</a>. como podria solucionarlo??
Hi Pedro, the command depends on what type of WordPress installation and the theme you have installed, try this command &quot;sudo nano /var/www/html/wp-content/themes/your-theme/functions.php&quot; you must replace &quot;your-theme&quot; with the name of your theme, however for installations with the Bitnami stack the path is &quot;sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs//wp-content/themes/your-theme/functions.php&quot;.
​ @Pietti My theme name is &quot;Rosa2 lite&quot;. Should I write like that without spaces?.
 <br />
 <br />Gracias :)
@Pedro Alexandre The folder for this theme is &quot;rosa2-lite&quot;.
@Pietti I was trying to get my website back since this morning!<br /> You really helped me to reach that!
 <br />Thanks so much once again.
Hi there! I can&#39;t open my WordPress dash board on my browser. Do you know how I can fixed it? I have thanks
​@Pedro Alexandre Depending on the issue you are having, there are a few steps you can take to get back your dashboard access: Enable cookies and clear cache, disable WordPress plugins, deactivate your currently active WordPress theme. Try this solutions to get you back in control of your WordPress.
@Pietti Thanks.. But how can I disables the plugins if I can&#39;t go inside by Website? There is any way to do it from the Google Cloud Platform?
@Pedro Alexandre you can disable all plugins use a SFTP client or using phpMyAdmin.
@Pietti Hi Rafael! My website has a big crash. I have to started a new project in Google Cloud Platform.
 <br />I migrate my website and I have it back. But i can&#39;t setup the domain inside the ssh. I changed the news DNS in my GooDady but some problems still. Do you know the reason for that?
 <br />
 <br />Thanks
@Pedro Alexandre DNS records must be configured in Google Cloud DNS, and they can take up to 72 hours to propagate.
Hello..Thanks for the video! Do you know the sudo command to reach the file functions.php in wordPress?

Hola para el caso de un subdominio funcionaría igual?
por cierto utilize la version kubernetes de wordpres como es ahi? es lo mismo?
@iran trinidad esas 3 instancias hacen parte de un grupo de instancias? debes configurar de acuerdo a tu nombre de dominio y el registro A sera el que resuelva a tu instancia principal o tu configuración especifica. Saludos
Cuando voy a vm instance me aparecen 3 opciones no se cual de ellas escoger, me podrias orientar un poco sobre esto?<br />solo eh creado una aplicacion del sitio web con wordpress.
Hola Drive si puedes alojar tantos dominios como quieras, simplemente creas una nueva zona y listo, inclusive puedes apuntar todos los dominios a una misma IP, y alojarlos en una sola instancia. Saludos
@Pietti muchisimas gracias por tu respuesta. ahora clarificas mi panorama estoy aprendiendo a programar js i python pero necesito dinero por esta pandemia i la forma mas rapida por el momento la vi con wordpress pero ese punto en la pregunta me alejaba de ello. porfin podre hacer paginas web venderlas i seguir por otro lado con la programacion . que Diosito te vendigo un millon de veces
@drive c me alegra mucho, aprende a sacar el mayor provecho de los servidores en Google Cloud, te permitirá monetizar tu negocio y ofrecerles a tus clientes un servidor rápido y seguro. Saludos
amigo tengo una pregunta que me mata de curiosidad puedo alojar con este metodo varios dominios en una cuenta de google cloud ? se que localmente si puedo pero en la zona que vivo el internet no es nada bueno para tener a los clientes con la senal illendose . te agredecere de corazon tu respuesta
Hola Guillermo, tienes una instalación Bitnami WordPress? si es así esta ruta te debe mostrar el archivo wp-config.php, ahora si es una instalación Multisite Bitnami WordPress este archivo es algo diferente. Si es otro tipo de instalación puede que la ruta sea esta &quot;sudo nano /var/www/html/wp-config.php&quot;. Saludos
segui todo los pasos, llegue al panel pero al ingresar el codigo sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/wp-config.php
 <br />no me sale lo mismo. alguien tiene idea que debo hacer?
Hola Zenon debes esperar que el dominio apunte a la IP puedes hacer un ping en tu computador y comprobar, a veces toma un poco mas de tiempo. Saludos
Maestro, ya hice todo tal cual lo indica, únicamente en la parte donde hay que cambiar en el WP-Config.php no me aparecen esas líneas porque hice una instalación normal de Wordpress (no con Bitnami).<br /><br />Ahora bien, al entrar a mi sitio (<a href="http://www.vyastores.com/">www.vyastores.com</a> o solo vyastores.com) me dice que &quot;No se puede acceder a este sitio web - No se ha podido encontrar la dirección IP del servidor de <a href="http://vyastores.com/">vyastores.com.</a>&quot;. No sé si es normal de momento, porque aún no se me activa mi dominio desde Namecheap. O es que el error es por otra cosa.
Me alegra que te haya funcionado. Saludos
amigo eres genial, de tanto tutorial que vi solo el tuyo me funciono al 100%
Hola si es posible, puedes apuntar un subdominio a otra máquina virtual o VM Instance. Solo debes configurar el registro A y el CNAME para que apunten al subdominio. Saludos
​@Pietti Gracias por tu respuesta, de verdad eres muy amable en contestar. funciono mas facil de lo que pensaba... <br />Tengo una duda adicional, despues de configurar el sitio con SSL, trate de activar plugins o de instalar o actualizar los ya existentes y me da el siguiente error: <br />Instalación fallida: No ha sido posible crear el directorio
 <br />Me imagino que es alguna falla en permisos de usuario chmod, como puedo habilitar esos permisos via shell?
@Imaginalo si puedes si es una instalación bitnami estos comandos normalmente restablecen los permisos correctos: &quot;sudo chown -R bitnami:daemon /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs&quot; después &quot;sudo find /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/ -type d -exec chmod 0775 {} \; &quot; y por ultimo &quot;sudo find /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/ -type f -exec chmod 0664 {} \;&quot;. Espero te funcionen. Saludos
@Pietti Wow... tal cual como lo dices, al ajustar esos permisos todo quedo funcionando perfectamente. Muchas gracias por compartir tus conocimientos.
Pietti una pregunta, es posible hacer esto mismo pero con un subdominio?
Hola recuerda que lo puedes forzar mediante el archivo wp-config.php para que tome tu nombre de dominio. Al reservar la IP estática esta se puede utilizar como IPv4 o IPv6. Saludos
@Pietti Ocurre que usás bitnami y yo otro y ahí no sé qué escribir en lugar de tu sudo/..... porque es diferente. Y traté de pegar el ipv6 igual al ipv4 pero no me lo reconoce <a href="http://nic.ar/">nic.ar</a> como posible =P estoy al llanto vivo.
tienes algún código para usar bitnami en tu nombre? hago un nuevo deployment y listo....
@Ariana Wajntraub normalmente en otro tipo de instalación WordPress que no sea con el stack Bitnami, la ruta es &quot;sudo nano /var/www/html/wp-config.php&quot;. Saludos
@Ariana Wajntraub lograste solucionarlo? Saludos
@Pietti Hola! Esto sí lo resolví!!! ya no sé ni cómo.... estoy detrás del ssl (sin bitnami) y ahí sí que me trabé. Abandono. No puedo más con esto y con el sudo y el openlinte q no me abre el :7080 :(
@Ariana Wajntraub puedes revisar esta lección que hace parte del curso de WordPress Google Cloud: <a href="https://pietti.com/curso/wordpress-google-cloud/leccion/instalar-certificado-ssl-apache-debian/">https://pietti.com/curso/wordpress-google-cloud/leccion/instalar-certificado-ssl-apache-debian/</a>.

Gracias de antemano!
Hola Elmer, puedes utilizar la misma configuración mostrada en el tutorial si quieres que el subdominio apunte a otra máquina virtual o VM Instance, simplemente creando el registro A y el CNAME debe contener el nombre del subdominio. Si tienes una instalación LAMP por ejemplo simplemente es habilitar el subdominio. Saludos
y para los subdominios que tipo de registro es?
Hola Daniel, este código no es necesario es para los dominios, puedes moverlo viendo este video: <a href="https://youtu.be/RnMpc5ofOm0">https://youtu.be/RnMpc5ofOm0</a>. Si ya termino tu prueba gratuita puedes activar la facturación sacar el respaldo para migrar como se muestra en el video y una vez hayas terminado el proceso solo debes borrar todo el proyecto en Google Cloud y así no te generara ningún costo. Saludos
@Pietti Muchas gracias, efectivamente no lo necesitaba
Hola ya terminé mi tiempo gratuito y quiero mover mi página a un hosting compartido en otra empresa pero me pide el EPP. Sabes como puedo encontrar este código en google cloud?
Hola Jose, estas seguro que tienes un usuario de administrador, si es así revisa si algún plugin u otro usuario te ha cambiado los privilegios. Saludos
Hola Excelentes videos, pregunta estoy editando la instalación de wordpress cuando voy a personalizar e intento guardar cambios, aunque estoy en perfil de administador sale una alerta que dice necesito un nivel mas alto de permisos para personalizar el sitio ¿Qué puede estar fallando?
Hola Jose, si se puede, simplemente tienes que crear el registro CNAME y el A para el subdominio. Saludos
Hola Excelentes tutoriales gracias por la información, tengo una duda, se pueden generar subdominios y crearles instalación wordpress de la misma manera?
Hola, gracias en el canal tenemos mas videos sobre Google Cloud y en este curso explicamos con mas detalle GCP: <a href="https://pietti.com/curso/wordpress-google-cloud/">https://pietti.com/curso/wordpress-google-cloud/</a>. Saludos
@Pietti mi pregunta es<br /> Sí quiero hacer un sitio web para un tercero. ¿Ningún código queda en mi equipo?<br />Como lo hace usted?
@Tavo ningún código queda en tu equipo, todo se ejecuta en el servidor directamente a través de una conexión SSH. Puedes trabajar tu proyecto en local y después migrar a el servidor en Google Cloud: <a href="https://youtu.be/RnMpc5ofOm0">https://youtu.be/RnMpc5ofOm0</a>. Este video muestra como hacerlo. Te recomiendo el curso. Saludos
@Pietti genial. Muchas gracias. Saludos desde Costa Rica
Me a encantado el vídeo. Creo que tienes que hacer más de estos. <br />Definitivamente hostear en google es la mejor opción pero es bastante compleja.
Hola Luis David, si es una instalación Bitnami si es necesario hacerlo, ya que este tipo de instalación no permite cambiar las URL desde el dashboard de WordPress. Saludos
Estimado una consulta porque es necesario realizar lo de (Editar las URL WordPress Bitnami Google Cloud) este paso lo pregunto no porque sea difícil, sino porque no entiendo porque hay que hacerlo o cual es tu utilidad.
Valoro mucho el contenido de los videos, considero que si el zoom de la pantalla fuera mejor sería simplemente Inmejorables los videos, pues aporta contenido de valor!
Hola depende de la region de la nueva instancia en GCP, pero normalmente solo se necesita cambiar el registro A con la nueva IP de la maquina virtual. Saludos
Hola muchas gracias por el video, espectacular!! Quiero saber como puedo cambiar un dominio entre consolas de gcp. Gracias
Hola Heidial, en el multisite de Bitnami, se maneja por subdominios del dominio principal por lo cual las lineas son distintas, te recomiendo ver la documentación oficial: <a href="https://docs.bitnami.com/general/apps/wordpress-multisite/">https://docs.bitnami.com/general/apps/wordpress-multisite/</a>.

@Pietti Gracias!
cómo es con el multisite de bitnami, el config sale distinto, o no sale nada donde cambiar el dominio

Hola Rafael. ya tengo la pagina y deseo agregarla a mercado shops de mercado libre pero me pide que cambie los dns. tengo el dominio de Telmex en google cloud. si cambio los dns en telmex la pagina dejara funcionar? correcto. por favor donde los cambio. saludos.
hola! tengo el mismo problema, lograste solucionarlo?
@Diego Franco No, creo que lo voy a borrar hacer una nueva instancia y omitir ese paso ya que antes almenos por la ip entraba
@Luis Daniel Castellanos esto depende del tipo de instalación que tengas si es Bitnami u otro tipo. Ahora recuerda que debes colocar estas lineas en el lugar correcto, y el dominio debe resolver correctamente a nuestra instancia en Google Cloud, esto lo podemos comprobar mediante un ping a el dominio y este debe devolvernos nuestra IP Estática. Ten en cuenta que la propagación de DNS puede tardar algún tiempo. Saludos
@Pietti Creo que ahora es wordpress by bitnami y Automatic ya no me sale la opcion de solo bitnami. Sera eso?
Al poner esto define (&#39;WP_SITEURL&#39;, &#39;<a href="http://www.dominio.com/&#39;);%E2%80%8B">http://www.dominio.com/&#39;);​
 </a><br />define (&#39;WP_HOME&#39;, &#39;<a href="http://www.dominio.com/&#39;)">http://www.dominio.com/&#39;)</a>; <br />en mi sitio me manda error 500 y aunque lo regrese a como estaba ya no lo resuelve.<br /><br />Este tutorial sigue actualizado?
Hola Ruben que tipo de instalación tienes? Ya lo lograste solucionar? Saludos
Hola Maestro! Terminé todos los pasos pero al finalizar este paso:<br />&quot;Y las vamos a reemplazar por nuestro dominio. Recuerde reemplazar la versión de DOMINIO con el www. o sin www. de acuerdo a su preferencia.&quot;<br />queda la página en blanco y no logro entrar al wp-admin, no aparece, que crees que puede pasar?
Gracias amigo!
Hola. Espero puedas ayudarme. el problema que tengo es que no puedo guardar los cambios en el SSH , cuando quiero cambiar mi dominio ...... define(&#39;WP_HOME&#39;,&#39;http://montehoreb.edu.pe&#39;);
 <br />define(&#39;WP_SITEURL&#39;,&#39;http://montehoreb.edu.pe&#39;); . me envía a mi dominio anterior a pesar que el moninio anterior ya lo elimine, quiero cambiar a un nuevo dominio que compre pero no puedo. Gracias por tu respuesta.
Hola Enrique las claves las puedes ver dando click sobre el nombre de tu instancia en Compute Engine. Saludos
Hola, se me cerró todo cuando realizaba el proceso y no pude entrar a la pagina de Wordpress, donde puedo ver las claves de acceso ?
Hola Hugo, ya solucionaste el problema? Saludos
Hola Pietti, hice los cambios desde ayer y me sigue diciendo:<br /><br />Esta página no funciona<br />La página &quot;nombre del sitio&quot; no puede procesar esta solicitud ahora.
 <br />HTTP ERROR 500<br /><br />Me podrias ayudar a saber cual es el problema?<br /><br />Muchas gracias, tus tutoriales me han ayudado muchisimo!
Hola, quiero que sepan, que al hacer este paso:<br /><br />define (&#39;WP_SITEURL&#39;, &#39;<a href="http://www.dominio.com/&#39;);%E2%80%8B">http://www.dominio.com/&#39;);​</a><br />define (&#39;WP_HOME&#39;, &#39;<a href="http://www.dominio.com/&#39;)">http://www.dominio.com/&#39;)</a>;<br /><br />Nunca se propagan las DNS, debe ser por la nueva actualización de Google porque antes si me funcionaba.<br /><br />Ahora la solución es, hacer todos los pasos, excepto el de cambiar los dns dentro de config.php, dejarlo sin cambios y entonces instalar luego el SSL solo con el sudo /opt/bitnami/bncert-tool
hola hize el proceso pero me sale error 500 ayuda
Hola Josel, si solo es necesario que pongas la IP estática y después verifiques el el registro DNS tipo A y listo. Saludos
Hola buenos días. Gracias por tus tutoriales son muy completos. Tengo un problema: por descuido dejé el tipo de IP en efimera y apenas me doy cuenta luego de completar todos los demás pasos. Existe alguna forma de arreglarlo? Gracias por tu tiempo.
Hola Josel depende del tamaño del proyecto y en que país te encuentres ubicado. Saludos
Hola. Cuánto debería cobrar por la creación de un sitio web corporativo utilizando los conocimientos que aprendí en tus cursos? Sobre la plataforma de Google Cloud
Hola Felix puedes conseguirla haciendo clic sober la VM instance, normalmente el usuario es USER y la contraseña aparece en los detalles de la instancia. Saludos
hola como estas, muy buen video. donde consigo otra vez las credenciales para ingresar al admin de wp. gracias
@Pietti Hola si yo estoy en la misma situación , cuanto tiempo se tiene que esperar no puedo ver la pagina ni entrar a wordpress. Por favor tu apoyo, de antemano gracias por tu ayuda.
Hola Maria debes seguir los pasos, y no deberías tener ningún problema, tienes que esperar que se propague la DNS. Saludos
Cuando realizo eso, luego ya no puedo ingresar a wordpress
Hola Juan, yo preferiría manejarlo desde GCP. Saludos
Si el dominio lo tengo con Google Domains, recomiendas aún así generar la Zona DNS en GCP? O estará bien gestionar desde Google Domains? Gracias de antemano.
Hola te recomiendo ver cada uno de los pasos y esperar que se propague la DNS. Debe funcionar correctamente. Saludos
hola hice todo estos pasos y ahora me sale ERROR 500, no puedo entrar a WP tampoco
Hola Angel, si deben funcionar perfectamente. Saludos
Saludos. Excelente tutorial, tengo una duda, esta configuración funcionaría de manera inversa?, es decir que los DNS de mi proveedor de dominio apunten a la IP estática de GCloud?
Hola, me está pasando lo mismo, he hecho varias páginas siguiendo este tutorial y todo bien, anoche lo hice de nuevo y la página no carga, sale HTTP ERROR 500
@Carlos Ambuludi al instante bro
funciona perfecto
me paso igual? lo pudiste resolver ?
@asderel09 muchas gracias bro, voy a seguir el video que me dejaste, saludos desde colombia
parcero ya lo logre, me funciono perfecto
bro lo hice varias veces antes y me funcionaba perfecto pero ahora lo hago y me sale error 500. teagradeceria mucho si puedes ayudarme

hola, estoy tratando de hacerlo y me dice error http 500
Hola, gracias nuevamente por tus videos. Queria preguntar, necesito Aparcar un par de dominios mas al que tengo en GCP. Puedo editar el htaccess directamente?, debo agregarlos desde Google Console?, podrias indicarme? gracias
Buenos tutoriales, pero no puedo con su cara muy amargada .-. me da no se desesperación, hay que darle emoción.
Tengo un problema a la hora de abirir el comando con Enter es el segundo que muestras cuando cambias la URL dice que el comando no existe sudo nano// etc

@intellipaat i guess the ans for quiz is c - storage service
Hi, Prior IT Experience would be an added advantage but not mandatory.
@intellopaat<br />What are the pre requisite to learn google cloud. Is non programmer can learn.
Okay. :)
cloud load balancing is a networking service
Welcome. Stay tuned to Intellipaat to keep learning. :)
Thanks for preparing this session
AWS
AWS or GCP?
Thank you for watching. :)
I was really looking for such a video where I will get whole idea and concept of GCP. Also, the significance of these various services offered by GCP and how actually these are interconnected with each other. It is really informative and excellent tutorial about GCP. Thank you so much for uploading it 👌👍😊
Glad you liked it. Keep learning with Intellipaat. :)
It&#39;s a networking service, cloud load balancing. Thanks for an amazing go through.

cool.
Cloud load balancing is a networking service
Good video for beginners
One yml file corresponds to one functionality in that bucket. Can you have more than one yml file for same bucket? Each yml file represents each functionality.
How one can create app for thier client and deliver them, do you need to use your account or client?
Cloud load balancing is networking
thanks!
Is anyone else preparing for the google online challenge for a cloud engineer internship? any link for question samples would be really nice 😅 this video is useful too but I would like to practice with multiple-choice questions
Im interested in GCP but my experience is in hardware and I am poor in coding, commands and scripting, please let me know what prerequisite(course/skills) i require if i want job in GCP as career
Love you sister nicely explained
Hello . I have a Laravel app. Can u please make a video how to upload and host an laravel application on google cloud platform. or can u guide me for doing that
network service is called load balancing.
I agree things were very well explained.
I second this! His explanations are really great!
more from this guy!!<br />he explain things well
This was a really good explanation of how to consider the different storage options on google cloud.
I have developed endpoints with python and wanted a jump start on java. This video was such a waste of time. I guess the goal of this video to show how &quot;quickly&quot; this can be done rather than teaching people to create endpoints. Sure you will do everything in 5min when your classes files are pre written. Thumbs down.
Awesome!!
Very well explained, wish he also touched a little on pricing model of each in that how you are charged for each service.
i like it
Very nicely explained, thanks!
Like the content but not the presentation , it&#39;s more like reading out not explaining what he understood .. just MHO.
I&#39;ve been able to make sense of the documentation(<a href="https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/">https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/</a>) plus there are sample applications to explore for various platforms (via client APIs) including PHP. If you go to google&#39;s API explorer you&#39;ll see that the Datastore API is at version 1 (<a href="https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#search/datastore/datastore/v1/">https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#search/datastore/datastore/v1/</a>). <br />I&#39;m building a tool that integrates with Datastore via its REST APIs and its going smoothly. Its not for everyone though; you should look into Firebase (also owned by Google) there are tonnes of tutorials out there and its easier to pick up than most. Firebase has its draw backs if you&#39;re coming from a SQL background but its good for a lot of use cases (for my current project it was a toss-up between Firebase and Datastore; we went with Datastore b/c of its support for SQL-like queries).
Yes, GCP needs to invest in forming a following especially outside the experienced developer realm.
I presume Google deliberately keeps this information from just anyone who wants to know. Third year university Computer Science majors and programmers understand the jargon, and at this level of commitment to the trade are more likely to not be mischievous. I&#39;m only guessing. I want to back up my MacBook hard drive to the cloud is all, like Time Machine does every day with ChronoSync … <a href="https://www.econtechnologies.com/chronosync/overview.html">https://www.econtechnologies.com/chronosync/overview.html</a> … and I may end up purchasing a commercial product to do so. Too much could go wrong and then not reliable to accomplish on my own; I don&#39;t know enough to have confidence with Google or Amazon Cloud.
Google Datastore documentation is a mess or non-existing. Its almost impossible to find coders out there who know about Google Datastore. As a small startup we have sped two months trying to find someone who coud make a simple client database, with a PHP page on an App Engine interacting with a Datastore DB. There is no info, no examples, not turtotials, only a bunch of files on github having alien code insid. You dont knw where to start and where to end - only info is what is in the middle. So far Datastore is a Goolgle flop, I tink no one is using it, no one can develop with it, newer versions are not backward compatible - in short stay clear og Google Cloud, its not even in beta but rather an experimental thing.
if I don&#39;t know much about the OS i&#39;ll install in the VM, would it matter what I use? I&#39;m worried about the security that someone might make something collapse and how to get it back up
Cold Storage pricing like Amazon Glacier or Google Nearline somehow is only more cost effective in end-user archiving scenarios when having a byte-sequence of unstructured data smaller than around 600 GB. Somehow even the Google pricing calculator can&#39;t beat CrashPlan&#39;s yearly pricing. So I think neither Google nor Amazons AWS has a good alternative for what CrashPlan is to end-user archiving needs.<br /><br />for nearline (why can&#39;t we directly save to coldline?) datastreams of roughly half a million object in a sequence of roughly 1700 Gigabytes other solutions seem to be more effective if you only want to archive.
OMG this video pure PORN! 10/10 would watch and nerd out again!!!!!
Welcome to the cloud. It&#39;s the same on all cloud platforms. I&#39;ve been developing in the cloud for 4 years and I&#39;m still learning. Some of this is due to the cloud providers adding services constantly.
Great and clear video.<br />I don&#39;t know if Google cares about capturing the small startups market at all, but if they do they should really make this kind of content more discoverable through the platform itself.<br />I was close to giving up on GCP and focusing my research efforts on other storage as a service providers because of the amount of proprietary terms and concepts the whole Google Ploud platform has. Now that I finally UNDERSTAND (at least a small part of) what it&#39;s all about I&#39;m gonna give it a second look.
Let me if given blow scenario is possible:<br />1.I have a asterisk based server and i want to save all call recordings in google nearline storage server. <br />2. That should be automatically like if any call warp up it must be automatically save in google nearline server.
Awesome tutorial, great explaining :)
what is cloud spanner?
SECURITY CONCERNS. I would like this spokesman to give a presentation focused on security for data, apps, etc.
Very well explained and didn&#39;t hesitate to get into the basics. Nice tutorial.
Thanks for this video. I loved it and it was very informative.
cluster autoscaling and node auto provisioning explanation both looks same to me ? any one can understand it ?
Now Archival storage also added
Very correct. It&#39;s outdated
This is vedio should be archived now. Please update with latest updated changes ( Google Cloud storage - Multi-Regional, Regional, Clod line &amp; Nearline)
Very well explained! I like how the example where ops-&gt;throughput-&gt;daily/yearly consumption, as I am struggling with making sense of GCP price calculator.
Updated version to include Cloud Spanner should be made available
Wow, this was way over my head! I won&#39;t be using Google storage.
Well Explained thanks
The service type and price policy change a lot now. Please update the video.
This is what you call the &quot;idiot&#39;s guide to cloud&quot; thumps up man.
Yes only cloud storage is for unstructured data
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYaprBSDy8A&amp;t=23m14s">23:14</a> - &quot;Wouldn&#39;t use BigQuery for real time Application&quot;. That confused me terribly. I thought BigQuery can be used for streaming analysis and querying where you get insights from the data even before it hits any storage. So Gabe, is your distinction more between real-time vs near real-time?
Is Cloud Datastore for structured data (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmjuMyRBPO4&amp;t=2m31s">2:31</a>)?
Great video and presenter!
Excellent presentation!
That was excellent.
You should be a teacher sir. I need to give a session on storage to my team. I am gonna imitate you.
some body help me how to multiple files upload google cloud in nodejs multer
Great video!!!!
Thanks for the notice, as I`m preparing for cert.
Google should remove or update the video as it is somewhat outdated now.
very useful thanks for all explanation
This is outdated..... Please post a new updated one..
Great video but the volume needs to be doubled or even tripled almost impossible to hear with headphones
thank
2020 still loving GCP!
Very informative. Great overview of GCP offering
great video, clear explanation, but extremely outdated services
Great explanation. One of the best explanation!!
This video goes from introductory-anyone-can-follow it (up to minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmjuMyRBPO4&amp;t=10m30s">10:30</a>) and then it warps light-speed ahead into a wormhole that only experienced database managers can pass.
Good overview, would like to see a video on Google BigQuery, querying, how to load data in and out of BigQuery
Please make a tutorial for creating vpc with public and private subnet. And working with bastion host concept. In Google Private Cloud
Hey Noman, Yes, you can use Google Cloud Storage as file server. Do refer to this link - it talks about how to use GC Storage as file server - <a href="https://www.roitraining.com/2016/03/21/using-google-cloud-storage-as-a-file-serverby-doug-rehnstrom/">https://www.roitraining.com/2016/03/21/using-google-cloud-storage-as-a-file-serverby-doug-rehnstrom/</a><br /><br />Hope this helps!
can i use google cloud storage as a file server.<br /><br />that is i can upload files to gcp and make it available for download for visiters in website.<br />is it possible.
Thanks for the compliment, Aduru! We are glad you loved the video. Do subscribe to the channel and hit the bell icon to never miss an update from us in the future. Cheers!
Good session on GCP storage
Can a Fresher, or a current year college pass-out student can do this course.
 <br />I am asking this question because they will not have 3+ year industry experience,
 <br />but if they start now they can have 1 year GCP experience.
In G Suit Application,<br />Being a Digital Marketer <br />May I get Real Time Insights of People Visiting Websites
So your problem is you are living in pakistan .
I am aneela amin butt I living in Pakistan city sialkot
Please do same for Azure cloud certification
can you please share the documents with us ????
Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We’re sorry you had a bad experience. We’ll strive to do better
Why you guys haven&#39;t any good mic? Very poor sound quality for Simplilearn
Gcp&#39;s some terrible issues make me feel it is made for personal, not for business.
Hi Katakwar, yes in most of the parameters aws is leading but other two is catching fast and there are features which are only provided by Azure and GCP exclusively so there is no clear winner here. It all comes down to the need of the business as a deciding factor.
Overall vote for AWS
Hi Katakwar, since AWS, Azure and Google cloud are the top 3 runner ups dominating cloud market, whereas VMware cloud is nowhere a close competition to these 3, that&#39;s why we have compared these cloud services.
Not discussed vmware
500 mbps in free micro version
Sir i wanted to know what Internet downloding speed will get in AWS AZURE AND GOOGLE which has the maximum downloading speed
That&#39;s true.
I have personally used GCP and EC2, GCP was very easy to use it takes few seconds to open the shell. Where in EC2 have to first exchange keys from my personal terminal(initially) then can use it (I guess to encounter frauds happening).
Not to mention the ball ache when designing true global networking features in AWS - Azure wins hands down!. As for Azure not being enterprise ready; really!??
Hi Vibhor, of course it is a little far from the other two but it is catching fast and you never know when Google surprise you with something. :)
@Intellipaat never would want it to happen. Not a fan of Google or any of its products. <br />I would love when something like digital ocean to succeed not Google and beats the big guns.
GCP doesn&#39;t really comes close to azure and aws
That&#39;s true Dileeban. :)
Google Cloud is the good one , In this world common human using smart phone (Android) on that phone each and every person using google search , youtube , gMail and google drive. Google is the best SSO and password manager for other common sites or the apps. When we talk about smart phones google won the game its real time backup all images, contacts , text , phone settings to the google cloud under the google account. each and every google account get 15GB of free cloud space. majority of peoples are using google cloud without their knowing about cloud.
Hi, indeed GCP is the best in terms of pricing and reliability.
I vote for GCP because it is cheaper, faster, it have by far the best kubernetes service around there and last but not least the networking model, in my opinion is the simplest and reliable. I&#39;d have liked to see a kubernetes service comparison here because this year k8s is the cloud native platform.
Sorry Duha, i didn&#39;t understand your query.
What is a solution in IT
Thanks. Keep learning with Intellipaat. :)
Awesome video!
Sorry not aware of the software since this was done by a different team. :(
What software was used in presentting this video?

@Nadeem Shaikh Datz right..
Cool. :)
How is it exactly more related to gaming? I bet that there are more games relying on AWS than Azure.
I would pick Azure since its more related to Gaming than any other Cloud infrastructure.
great. :)
Azure
Thanks. Stay tuned to Intellipaat channel. :)
great video
In a way it&#39;s true Pramod. :)
GCP has shown great potential but AWS is winner...Azure despite having 2nd largest share has huge downtime as comapred to AWS and GCP......
How can we compare these three on the basis of storage?
What are their security features and what security features are on their roadmap?
I guess Azure is secured since Most Healthcare and Banking industries prefer azure over Aws
AWS is compatible with different databases. I feel that is leading them to grab the market.<br /><br />@Intellipaat<br />Which one is secure?<br /><br />Primary aspect to look at
AWS ...S3 is better option
AWS (S3 bucketing)
What a great presentation, we are already on Azure but facing some performance issues, looking for a scalable performant object storage solution. Suggestions??
Azure
Azure
Talk of region first
Glad you liked it. Keep learning with Intellipaat. :)
Thanks for sharing the video, ver comprehensive comparison!<br />Amazon and Google have something Microsoft doesn´t: data from end consumers<br />And Microsoft has something the other two runners up don´t have: over 40 years of experience designing and deployment software systems at both enterprise and consumer levels<br />IMO, AWS and GCP are a bit ahead when it comes to advanced analytics, machine learningm and AI<br />But Microsoft is rapidly picking up, specially since Nadella was named CEO in Feb 2014<br />Interesting cloud battle...
You can go ahead for AWS Solutions Architect course. If you are interested, then get in touch with our course advisor at: +91-7022374614
Hello sir, <br />I&#39;m oldest subscriber of intellipaat, i never miss any video related to my field and it helps me a lot.<br /><br />But I have one query, i have 3 yrs of experience in desktop support which Technology should i select for career?
Cool. :)
Azure
cool.
AWS hands down for IaaS!!
welcome.
Thanks
Sure Mohammad, thanks for your feedback. We will forward it to the concerned team.
Please reduce the background music
how many mistakes in the information aws availability zones are 69+ i dont want watch this anymore
Thank you for watching. :)
NICE
All cloud providers are same, they give very limited access in lite plan.Number of simultaneous connections and optimisations are compromised.
Sure, will forward the topic to the respective team and will upload the video soon. Please subscribe to Intellipaat channel &amp; press the bell icon so that you don&#39;t miss that video from us.
Sir make a video on hack pick a performance optimisated AWS instance and setup them because in free tier it hangs a lot please make video on this topic
Thank you for watching. :)
Actually, this is a great presentation. All I can see is the fight is on. All three are going for it. Maybe we should ask which one is likely going to get swallowed up or will go bankrupt first.<br />One point did make me laugh. 66 seconds? or 79 seconds? Hmmm.... It&#39;s cool, I know what you meant (.66 and .79 of an hour), it&#39;s just funny.
Thanks for the video!
Depends on requirement.
What do you care most when choosing cloud? cost? security? Storage? Or what else?
Can some one please share information about the learning and certification paths for all the clouds in one video like this ? It’s quite apprehensive but missing the learning part ! 🙂
the music is pretty annoying.
cool.
AWS
thank u
Can we manage Nosql DB , such as mongodb ?
good video
Sorry this could well be interesting but there&#39;s no way I can watch 15 minutes of this with the background music.
Glad it was helpful!
Thank you. Very informative.
Thank you for watching.🙂
Very good overview, answered all my questions and I know now that I can choose the right platform with confidence. Thank you.
Hi, thanks...can you make a video on how to make an email template, that I can send to my prospective customers , which contains at last option to open/install my playstore app and social media button frorm.where by clicking that customers can easily open our social media page.. if you make a tutorial.for that it will be gr8...
Thank you for your explanation, very useful for me!
cool.
I prefer GCP&#39;s company values over AWS any day since I want to respect the company&#39;s i work for
@Intellipaat, please let me know what should a startup should choose having limited funds and Node.js compatibility? Thanks in advance!
GCP will surpass the other two due to its simplicity and great potential. AWS might fall back due to overwhelming services which are quite sometime confusing for customers to choose and Azure as always leaning towards Microsoft products. So, I think GCP is the winner.
Hey, great video. Gives a bird&#39;s eye view of all 3 of them to decide which to choose from.
absolutely.
Thanks for explanation, so the point is always what we needed in our condition.
cool
My favorite is GCP
Great video! Super clear and discussed the main points. Thank you!
All provide Auto Scaling?
how long is 2 hours and 69 minutes? or 39 hours and 77 minutes ??
Very good comparison. Thanks
Oracle and Ibm would have been there in the comparison
Microsoft Azure
Great Job! The background music was not that bad, thanks for putting this together 😄
Google cloud because it uses object storage and faster than both of them , pricing is low , fast growing market of Google
i am now confident to start my GCP
Thanks!
Good content!
Very important for interview...thank u for upload
what is the difference between Amazon WorkSpaces and Amazon EC2?
All 3 have great cloud platforms in all of their data centers, services like Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, Xcloud, Stadia, etc... all rely on these cloud platforms. That&#39;s all I have to say.
I am happy to go through this video .as before watching this video my organization asked me to choose any cloud platform to learn and I choose gcp....google has best geeks in world
Good useful content!. If I may have a suggestion - Could you slow down on the pace of narration? It always helps ad pause between sentences instead of rushing from one to the next :)
Where is Oracle ?

You should include Alibaba cloud.
I need azure storage conceps plese help bro <br />How to store azure upload and download using dot net dicom images
Glad you think so!
Good Comparison Video
Since google is providing very good service and also great at stealing our data, i am confused greatly between GCP and AWS
Very helpful
any free tool that recognizes best in each role?
Excellent video.. 👍
Sorry, but you are wrong when you compare AvZone between AWS and Azure... AWS and Azure give two different meaning to Av Zone.... for Azure the AWS av Zone are Regions and each region has three Av Zone.
I had around 5 years of experience In Banking sector as Sales officer and Customer representative..I didn&#39;t like the Job because of Heavy pressure and self respect..I want to switch to IT sector..Can u pls guide me the best course ..I want to go with AWS ..does it need any programing skills?..Pls do help me 🙏

Gcp is good just beacuse of andriod they are winning how to implement apps and upload on cloud
Gcp is good , andriod is great olatfirm
I think GCP is better
cool.
I am a great fan of GCP since it is developer friendly , so I prefer GCP
Hi, while watching video at the time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n24OBVGHufQ&amp;t=10m32s">10:32</a>, you were saying Azure offers about 128 vCPUs at 6.79 per hour, but on screen it shows 3.97 per hour. Can you correct it if possible? But apart from that, video is very good. We are using AWS, but seeing the growth of GC I agree with you that it might beat AWS. But wanted to know how good the support team is for GC?
Each and every person and business are using google services directly and indirectly..... So it could be good choose to go GCP..
gcp is the best for indian because of prices
Intellipaat is one which cloud ???
I am certified on all 3 Cloud platforms Associate level. And I tell you GCP is the best for me. The best console UI, simplicity, faster instance builds, micro services(K8’s) and much cheaper.
Excellent video ... got to know so many things in one go.
i need full of cloud computing
Please remove the background music
This video is OK, but for one with a much different style check out my AWS vs Azure vs GCP comparison!
AWS is boss and leader
This is quite outdated and there are discrepancies in the services mentioned like Azure’s monitoring service mentioned which is app insight, which is only used for application monitoring. They failed to mention that Azure has Azure Service Health that actually monitors not only Apps (e.g. web apps) but even the services you installed.
AWS
Don&#39;t forget that recently AWS lost big time to Azure on a titanic deal. The Universe has been unfair to Microsoft but deep down, everyone knows that noone provides more unit quant than Microsoft.
Great presentation! good comparison between all the three big player. <br />on a side note, is it just me or anybody else who thought &quot;Why are we calling it &lt;2 hours 69 mins&gt; instead of &lt;3 hrs 9 mins&gt; or &lt;39 hrs and 77 mins&gt; instead of &lt;40 hrs 17 mins&gt;&quot;.
I tried the google cloud free tier. They gave me $300 in credits. After trying a simple web app for a month it cost $50 and it really wasn&#39;t that impressive. I felt there was no use pursuing it if the initial price was so high.
GCP and Azure will grow at higher rate in the future as they provide the OS and the productivity tools. So it would be a one complete solution for enterprise like docs, emails, calendar, drive, ChromeOS laptops, cloud backend services etc. That is where amazon might have a tough time as GCP and Azure might bundle them together.
Thanks. Good, Brief and Complete enough.
Thanks for the brief description of the three cloud computing services. This was so helpful
besides from supported databases, i will go with GCP. It is simple, fast and the downtime very good. I also see more open source technologies attaching to GCP
how to make presentations like this?
Hi Wilson, Noted.
I agree with one of the viewers. Perhaps you could do another presentation with more updated data. Overall great job. Thank you!
39 hours and 77 minutes....!
Google cloud. Hands down.
Great suggestion!
Great video! And very insightful for those learning about cloud service offerings. It would be interesting to see where IBM compares to the others, especially now that they&#39;ve acquired Red Hat.
Thank you. You can find it in video settings. Keep learning with Intellipaat😊
This was intense! I mean, take a deep breath and speak for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n24OBVGHufQ&amp;t=14m16s">14:16</a> minutes non-stop. Good info - is there a slow motion button somewhere?
Welcome😊
Thanks bruh!
Dunno if anyone cares but I just hacked my girl friends Instagram password by using Instaportal. Just google for it enjoy!
@Reid Dane trying it out right now. Seems promising :)
Merci beaucoup pour la formation !!!
Super cette présentation, très utile avec une excellente qualité. Merci pour le partage
Merci
Bonjour, dans l&#39;ordre ce sont : Didier Girard, Seifeddin Mansri, Rodrigue Bouleau, Jérôme Nahelou, Sébastien Friess et Thomas Gros
quelqu&#39;un connait les noms des presentateurs ?
Tu fais une conférence avec une console... mais tu fais bien gaff à ce qu&#39;on ne puis rien lire dessus... bravo...
D&#39;autant plus utile que le covid a bloqué toutes les conférences en live
quel formation faut-il ou debuter pour se former pour le cloud j&#39;ai besoin d&#39;une orientation svp...
Glad you think so!
very useful 👍
Doc AI,🥺💝
❣️❣️❣️
Thanks 👍
Nice video 👍
Google is getting SOLUTION for HACKING
Nesse caso você vai precisar criar um servidor SMTP para funcionar. No google cloud
Professor me ajuda por favor como criar um servidor SMTP estou utilizando Ubuntu.<br /><br />Já tentei de muitas formas mais não esta funcionando
Tenho uma pagina php feita para enviar um email, mais quando envio para a minha maquina virtual no google cloud e tento enviar email, não funciona.<br /><br />Como faço para funcionar?
Opa Marcos! Não conheço não. Valew continue acompanhando.
Só falta vc me dizer que conhece o Maudy Pedrão ....mas curto seus vídeos eu só aprendo
Massa!
Valew continue acompanhando!
Aprendo várias coisas nesse canal
Obrigado
Show já estou usando o Google Cloud Platform
Valew continue companhando os videos sobre google cloud platforme.
Sem dúvidas o melhor vídeo sobre Google Cloud Platform
Valew espero de fato contribuir!!! Para seu conhecimento.
APREENDO VÁRIAS COISAS NO CANAL
Organicamente no facebook é dificil apenas anunciando.
E qual valor mínimo tem que investir por dia no anúncio ?
Pelo menos 20 reais dia
Eu já desconfiava do Facebook em relação ao tráfego. E como eu tô fazendo o curso vendedor anônimo do Bruno Marinho.talvez vc conheça Ele não informou sobre isso...
Afonso será que tem como atrair muito tráfego para minha página do Facebook organicamente ou precisa fazer algum invéstimento ? Me responde quando puder
Como faço pra cancela a forma de pagamento?
Só se você quiser.
Olá! Uma pergunta: Depois de decorrido esses 365 dias... passa a ser cobrado ?
é sim mais não vai compeçar
@Afonso Alcântara pq a propria mineradora ela bloqueia minera em maquinas cloud
É possível minerar Bitcoin no Google cloud ?
Vai de acordo com o seu consumo após os 12 meses mais antes de cobrar o google cloud vai te perguntar se é para proseguir
Boa noite, e depois dos 12 meses de avaliação, como fica? valores dos planos? grato!
O google tem um serviço especifico para isso, que é o Cloud Storage, você acha lá dentro do painel, tem a opção do &quot;Coldline&quot; que é uma linha para armazenamento de arquivos de Backup (dificilmente acessados frequentemente)
Sim vale a pena se vc tiver algo que precisa ficar em segurança.
Não sei se é uma pergunta boba, mas lá vai... Vale a pena uma pessoa normal usar essa nuvem (como se fosse um Google drive)? Vale a pena (custo/beneficio)?
Sim ;) pois é no servidor do google! Funciona 24hrs e você também pode desligar o servidor quando desejar e será cobrado só pelo tempo de uso.
Pode ser uma pergunta besta, mas, por exemplo se eu desliga o meu computador essa plataforma ainda continua rodando?
Sim pode criar o que desejar.
Posso criar uma plataforma estilo Google Drive ou Google Photos usando a Google Cloud?
Você não será cobrado o google cloud é gratuito por 12 meses. Antes de cobrar ele vai perguntar a você se deseja continuar.
Mano ajuda ai assinei isso aí sem querer e nem sei valor ou preço agora não consigo remover o cartão das formas de pagamento me ajuda por favor mano
Nesse caso é sua internet que está lenta e da esse delay
@Afonso Alcântara Minha internet é de 100mb, como fica as máquinas aí pra você? Consegue ter um alto desempenho?
Aqui normal verifica sua taxa de upload se não está limitada.
@Afonso Alcântara Minha taxa de upload é de 10mb segundo o speed test. Creio que não seja internet, já que a VM até travou hoje usando com muita CPU no Windows Server 2019.
Porquê mesmo com todos esses núcleos, a máquina fica lenta? mesmo depois de criá-la.. Já cheguei a botar uma máquina com 160 vCPUs e ainda não pareceu mais potente do que a que a minha máquina modesta aqui de casa.
Vc pode usar o site <a href="http://www.wetransfer.com/">www.wetransfer.com</a> e ai vc abre o seu email pela maquina virtual e baixa os arquivos.
Opa, bom dia irmão! Então, eu criei minha maquina virtual. Deu turo certinho. Agora vc poderia me explicar como faço pra transferir alguns arquivos meu do meu pc pra maquina virtual. Teria algum vídeo explicando isso. Obrigado e valeu pelo vídeo.
Tenta criar uma nova maquina seguindo os passos do vídeo. Depois que gerar a senha conforme o video. Espera alguns minutos e tenta logar.
Amigo fiz tudo certinho, mas quando acesso pelo arquivo RDP ele pede denha e usuario bonito, coloco o que ele mesmo deu e não loga nem fude%$#$#. Oque pode ser? Obrigado.
Parabéns, excelente video!
Para abrir seu server só pelo computador mesmo. Aconselho assistir o vídeo novamente e seguir os passos.
Ocorreu um erro ao carregar /home/dashboard?project=model-folio-230506&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;pli=1. Consulte projeto O código é válido e você tem as permissões necessárias para acessá-lo. Saiba mais<br /><br /><br />estou com esse problema no meu, nem no celular consigo proceder
Apenas configuração via computador.
Tem pra celular tem como ter Pc nele pq eu não tenho 😢
A senha só é gerada apenas uma vez quando é criado o servidor. Nesse caso terá que criar uma nova maquina virtual
Como faz para recuper senha <br />Aquela que ele gera cheio de de ícones ?<br />Pois nao consigo logar coloco usuario e colo a senha e nao vai
O google cloud é gratis por 12 meses. E só paga pelo o que usar após esse período
@Afonso Alcântara Valeu man!
Alguém pode me ajudar? Eu fui olhar o meu cartão de crédito hoje e está aparencendo três combranças de 300,00 Reais de Google Cloud Platform. Eu não fiz inscrição em nada e muito menos altorizei uma compra de uma coisa que nem faço idéia do que seja. Antes de olhar esse vídeo eu nem sabia o que era isso, comecei a entender um pouco depois de algumas pesquisas. Mas a minha dúvida é em relação ao pagamento desse serviço caso eu não consiga fazer o extorno: Eu só pago se usar? A combrança já esta no meu cartão!
Sem dúvida estamos falando de servidores google
@Afonso Alcântara Obrigado pela resposta Afonso, cliquei no seu link pra dar uma olhada<br /><br />Eu quero tirar a dúvida pra um amigo também.<br /><br />Ele contratou a Hospedagem Business do Godaddy, e lá diz:<br /><br />1 núcleo de CPU alocado virtualmente
 <br />2GB RAM
 <br />Armazenamento de 60GB
 <br />Certificado SSL<br /><br />Isso deixa o site mais rápido também?
Sim dependendo da necessidade do site
Com Google Cloud meu site fica mais rápido?
Show se inscreveu no canal?
@Afonso Alcântara sim bro!
Show de bola, deu certo aqui a máquina, tá ligeira!<br />Valeu!
O seu cartão de credito é inserido apenas para habilitar sua conta. Não será cobrado nada. Acredito que àqueles cartões de credito pré pago funcionem sim
Ola pode me tirar uma duvida, a google aceita cartao pre pago para poder criar a conta no google cloud, se sim ok ...Se a resposta for nao pode dar uma sugestão
Amigo da uma busca no faq no google cloud lá tem tudo
como criar um certificado SSL para domínio e sua senha. Como que faço?
Sim pode se souber configurar um webservice.
@Afonso Alcântara muito obrigado por responder minha dúvida . Você ganhou mais um inscrito.
Posso hospedar um site nesse Servidor ? . Obs : sou iniciante . Obrigado!
Vai depender dos serviços que vc ativar no servidor vc tem 12 meses grátis
Tenho uma pergunta quanto custa esse serviço do Google cloud?
ele é um pc real que a google libera para que nós possamos acessar
Sim funciona
Tenho dúvidas, Da para criar e usar pelo celular? Ele funciona como um PC real? Tipo da para instalar aplicativos ?
é possível ter um painel de controle dentro do servidor criado no google cloud <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pricing/">https://cloud.google.com/pricing/</a> - como Cpanel, Direct Admin ou Cyber Panel? Tipo, fácil utilização, pois não temos conhecimentos root ou PuTTy. 2 vCPU 2 GB memoria, 100GB SSd, - 10TB Bandwidth, qual o valor aproximados. pois se é cobrado por hora e o server tem que ficar ligado 24 horas, como fica isso?
 <br />O que eu quero, é construir como se fosse um VPS, e instalar diversos sites dentro dele, para revenda. é possível?.
O processo depende do sistema operacional que vc está usando. Deve pesquisar sobre backup windows server e debian
Como fazer backup da máquina em poucos passos???
As vezes não está disponivel server de sp. O da california é bem melhor mais rápido
Amigo, não consegui criar em São Paulo, coloquei na região certa, quando fui pesquisar meu IP, deu IP da Califórnia, criei varias e todas do mesmo jeito, o que posso fazer para corrigir?
Recomendo começar o processo de criação do server do zero acompanhando o vídeo
Bom dia mano, quando configuro o PC e mando criar esta aparecendo uma msg de &quot;erro na guia disco&quot;, sabe o que pode ser?
Na garagem ✌
cade a sua bmw?
Tenta outra configuração em um servidor alocado em outra região
Eu tento colocar uma gpu ai aparece limite de cotas ..... oq eu devo fazer?
Nesse caso amigo vc vai precisar de um programador
@Afonso Alcântara <br />Entendi muito obrigado
Boa tarde como criar uma api para usar em plaforma de rastreamento
Sim vai ele fica no servidor do google
Se eu desligar o meu pc, esse servidor vai continuar aberto ?
Se vc continuar a usar os serviços e seus creditos promocionais tiverem acabados sim. Mais antes o sistema vai te perguntar
@Afonso Alcântara Esse valor é mensal?
quando acabar o 360 dias ele vai cobrar a fatura ?
Como ver o IP? Esse ip dele dá pra ser usado em http injecto contas SSH ...Com qualquer porta?

Não vale a pena. Serviço para isso seria caro
@Afonso Alcântara excluir a outra pergunta,desculpe .👍🏾
Vale apena contratar para minerar?<br />E pagando será ultilização ilimitado durante o ano todo?<br />Vai cobrar mensalmente ou anualmente?
Tenta reconfigurar com outra região do servidor
OLA o meu ate abre mais fica somente uma tela preta
Sim Se o Servidor for Windows procura um serviço chamado RDP
BLZ ?? Cara eu preciso instalar um programa que não roda no Macbook ,eu instalando no servidor eu consigo por exemplo configurar uma vpn no servidor ou baixar o Team viewer nele pra poder fazer essa vpn pra esse programa continuar funcionando corretamente como se fosse no meu notebook mesmo?<br />valeu pelo video estou chegando onde queria só preciso saber essa questão.
Tente ver nas configurações da VM criação de actions
Parabens Afonso muito lucida a video aula sobre o cloud google. Tenho uma pergunta: como programar para que uma instancia de vm do google ative de desative programaticamente outra instancia?
Teria que testar para ver mais a questão é a conexão é não processamento pra se fazer uma Live de qualidade.
@Afonso Alcântara ok
Olá amigo bom sei q este tipo de plataforma não foi feito pra isso mas queria saber se da pra fazer live de dentro da máquina virtual?
Vc pode usar o google cloud para isso
@Afonso Alcântara vou testar pra ver se da certo... Obrigado!!!
Amigo sabe de alguma maquina assim para usar com windows 10 para poder instalar aplicativos adobe? ABraço!!!
Amigo ensina a passar os arquivos pra la , uso o windows em uma instancia e nao acerto nem a pau, alguem ajuda pf
Só usar normal o PC dentro da virtual machine
fala mano?<br />como eu instalo programas na VM<br />criei uma maquina Datacenter Windows 2008 por ser mais barato
Sim se configurar um servidor php
Há a possibilidade de com essa máquina, subir meu site para ela e usar o Mautic para Marketing Digital?
Servidores de SP as vezes não funcionam tente na california
Eu criei usei o crédito de teste grátis mas não gostei muito, então não desejo pagar. Mas chegou uma nota fiscal no Gmail eu terei que pagar ?
@DCYBER MC oque deu a cobrança ?? foi feita mesmo ?? teve que pagar ?
Tentei de todas as formas criar uma instância com IP de São Paulo, criando inclusive o IP externo estático e não funciona. O que eu posso fazer?
Se você souber configurar um servidor PHP sim + MySQL
Eu fiz tudo conforme explicou muito bem. Agora eu gostaria de saber se é possível migrar um site wordpress para este servidor? Obrigado.
Configurações de conta vc pode cancelar
Queria saber e como cancelar a conta
Crie uma VM Server Windows. Veja se seus créditos não acabaram
olhando para o Pc a sua esquerda no canto superior tem três barras, clica nela, depois clique em &#39;faturamento&#39;, logo em seguida clica em &#39;visão geral&#39;, no canto inferior esquerdo dessa página tá escrito &#39;fazer upgrade&#39;, clica, depois clique novamente na mesma opção, logo em seguida vai nas notificações e clique em &#39;tentar novamente&#39; na notificação dizendo que n deu certo a ou crie outra.
Eu escolho a imagem para o Windows e quando crio o servidor, fala que não posso criar na forma gratuita sendo VM Windows. O que fazer?
Google Cloud
Qual empresa oferece a máquina mais barata?
Olá obrigado! Continue acompanhando o canal comprei a KABUMM confere lá
@Afonso Alcântara Acho que achei ele. obrigado.
Que demais, melhor coisa que descobri.<br />Ótimo vídeo, já ganhou um inscrito! <br />- Só por curiosidade, qual o modelo desse gabinete no fundo? muito lindo.
Máquina virtual vc pode acessar ela de qualquer lugar do mundo deixar arquivos seguros e etc..
Olá, ótimo vídeo! Eu sou meio leigo no assunto e ainda estou tentando aprender várias coisas. No momento eu gostaria de saber em que situações eu vou querer ter uma máquina virtual. Pq é melhor eu fazer isso do que usar meu computador normalmente? <br /><br />(lembrando que sou leigo, sem hate pls)
Configurações de conta e serviços
Ja acabou meu saldo gratuito como cancelo meu vps para poder fazer outra
Se vc deixar o servidor ligado sim.
legal, mas e depois que os creditos acabarem o que acontece? o google vai sair comendo seu cartão e vc vai perceber depois o rombo ?
Confira se vc gastou todos os créditos
Sim gastou todos os créditos se eu não pagar o que acontece?
Eu criei usei o crédito de teste grátis mas não gostei muito, então não desejo pagar. Mas chegou uma nota fiscal no Gmail eu terei que pagar ?
Valew Mestre Roger.
Ótimo vídeo
Obrigado continue acompanhando o canal
Gostei
Por cancelar antes. Se não usar não vão te cobrar.
Se eu cancelar sem usar os valores oferecidos pela Google e nem estourando o tempo de 1 ano, eles cobram? Posso cancelar antes ?
Não no caso seria outro serviço
Amigo e possível comprar domínio com crédito da Google clound ?
Mas boa sorte jogar, o Google Stadia é isso, sugiro que pesquise
Da pra jogar sim tranquilo
Só um dúvida esse computador virtual, como o meu PC é fraco eu posso instalar algum jogo mais pesando nessa configuração, como o meu PC não rodava então nessa configuração roda de boa?
Nao precisa de placa de vídeo só uma internet boa
Esses PC virtual da Google como funciona tem placa de vídeo sei lá rsrsrsrs...
Sim consegue sem prol
bom dia!<br>Eu consigo fazer acesso a internet normalmente ou apenas aplicações do google? por exemplo acessar facebook instagran, blogs, outros sites de busca etc.
Sim pode baixar não funciona pelo cel
Afonso Alcântara tem algum video ou dica sua sobre pc virtual?
Posso baixar jogos?Funciona pelo celular?
Nesse caso vc tem que fazer o backup da máquina normal como se tivesse no PC de casa
Amigo Parabens! Como copiar os dados da vm no periodo de 30 dias citados a partir do encerramento do periodo de avaliacao?
Conseguiu resolver? O meu cobrou também e estava em período gratuito de 12 meses
Tenta entrar em contato com o suporte então
O meu está cobrando mesmo sem ter passado o valor
Coloque IP fixo
@Afonso Alcântara Mesmo assim, deixei Statico, e não funciona, crio as regras no firewall, e mesmo assim testo as portas e da CLOSED
Amigo, não consigo criar Servidores de Jogos nas Instancias, pelo fato do maldito IP Local e o Ip Externo, sempre da erro em qualquer server de Jogo que vou fazer, como Solucionar ? pois em vps normais, so fica UM IP apenas e server pra tudo, esses da google e amazon e um saco, nao consigo ligar servidores de Jogos !<br><br><br>da uma Ajuda ai !
Esses servidores já tem esse tipo de defesa
Vc pode usar a cloudflare
​@Afonso Alcântara amigo sabe algum vm online que pegue windows server com avalicao gratuita, sem ser a azure e aws
Opa bom dia,<br>Como faço pra colocar proteção contra ataque?<br>tipo ataques DDOS.
@Afonso Alcântara mas como se muda de uma SSH para uma RPD?
SSH é promt de comando.
boa noite criei uma vm e eu nao consigo usar uma maquina RPD, só SSH.<br>TIpo ela nao abre como se fosse uma pc virtual e sim como no promt de comando.
Não vai pq vc encerrou o serviço
@Afonso Alcântara valeu
Se os creditos acabarem e eu encerrar o plano ainda sim vai cobrar do cartao?
Sim pode criar nesse vídeo crio uma VM
Versão free não deixa criar VM?
Valew Celso já se inscreveu no canal?
@Afonso Alcântara já sim lider.
Top, ficou fera. Obrigado amigo.
Depende da configuração da VM que vc está fazendo
Quanto custa pra criar uma VM ? com os creditos concedidos da pra criar?
Como assim limitado ?
Só se foi limitado mesmo. Mais tenta novamente com uma VM mais básica.
@Afonso Alcântara ahh, vlw, man!
@HGcontato Então, diz que o windows server não está disponível. É necessário atualizar para a versão paga para utilizá-lo. Por isso o &quot;limitada&quot;.
Windows: olhando para o Pc a sua esquerda no canto superior tem três barras, clica nela, depois clique em &#39;faturamento&#39;, logo em seguida clica em &#39;visão geral&#39;, no canto inferior esquerdo dessa página tá escrito &#39;fazer upgrade&#39;, clica, depois clique novamente na mesma opção, logo em seguida vai nas notificações e clique em &#39;tentar novamente&#39; na notificação dizendo que n deu certo a ou crie outra.
Ótimo vídeo!<br>Mas ocorreu um problema: Diz que o VM Windows Server não está disponível para a versão gratuita, embora eu tenha créditos...
Vc precisa liberar a porta smtp
@Afonso Alcântara Já liberei as portas 25,465,587,2525 lá em regras de firewall. Mas... Nécas de enviar emails
Sabe como faz para enviar e-mail pela instância do Google Cloud? Já configurei o servidor completamente, mas ele não envia e-mail para fora de jeito nenhum, apenas recebe. Seu canal é show, parabéns.
Sim vai
eu tenho um robô que opera no mercado financeiro, eu preciso deixar ele online 24h por dia, no caso é so eu abrir ele na vm que ele fica rodando mesmo com o meu pc real desligado?
Sim pode.
Pode usa para revenda de hospedagem de sites ?
Opa a VM vai comprar por uso da máquina ligada em processamento ao criar vc vai ver os valores que são totalmente configuráveis. Quanto ao Office hoje tem o Office 360 que você usa online e não precisa instalar na máquina
@Afonso Alcântara Grato. Mas haverá cobrança uma única vez ou a renovação é anual? Ou valores cobrados por tempo de utilização? Agradeço muito seus esclarecimentos.
Afonso. Bom Dia. Estou avaliando criar VM e pra ser sincero... é algo bastante disruptivo pra minha geração... acostumada ao velha instalação do windows no laptop e os programas básicos do Office. Pergunta: será necessário comprar as licenças do Office. Correto? O custo de ter a VM é anual...sempre tem que ser renovado? Se afirmativo...a título de exemplo...qual o valor desta configuração que vc escolheu? Grato e agradeço seus esclarecimentos. Sua atividade beneficia muitos... parabéns.
Qual seria o erro?
não esta funcinando pra win e no ubunto so da ssh
@Afonso Alcântara o google cloud n esta mais aceitando conta free com windows server
Tente criar uma máquina virtual com configurações mais baixas.
Windows VM instances are not included with the free trial. To use them, first enable billing on your account. Youll still be able to apply your free trial credits to eligible products and services. Esse é o Erro amigo
Vai depender da configuração que você efetivar
porque é tão caro?
@Afonso Alcântara Windows não roda na versão free? é isso mesmo?
Tente configurar uma VM básica e insira seu cartão. Pra liberar. Quando acabar o saldo promocional é só não continuar
galera to quase deixando esse google de lado <br><br>tudo que crio aparece a mensagem (As instâncias da VM do Windows não estão incluídas na avaliação gratuita. Para usá-los, primeiro ative o faturamento na sua conta. Você ainda poderá aplicar seus créditos de avaliação gratuita a produtos e serviços qualificados. ) se eu to na versão de avaliação gratuita e tem 1300,00 na conta por que não posso criar a maquina que eu quero <br>não tem lógica que negocio confuso
Vc acessa normal com sua conta do gmail mais pode configurar um IP fixo tambem
@Afonso Alcântara O aplicativo será acessado por várias pessoas, neste caso eles não podem usar a minha senha, seria um aplicativo para Android que eu mesmo desenvolvi
Bom dia! No Google cloud eu recebo um endereço IP Fixo para acessar os dados usando um aplicativo ?
Os custos são alternados vc pode verificar os valores na hora da sua configuração
qual foi o custo final dessa maquina?
Vc pode aumentar o espaço tbm do disco.
@Afonso Alcântara como eu tenho que fazer para aumentar espaço no ssd você pode me dar uma dica
Isso ta top caralho pra q tanta coisa
Beleza criei uma máquina virtual<br>Com uma velocidade de 1gb de internet,agora o que adiantar ter velocidade e não ter espaço<br>Porque só dá opção de 250gb ssd<br>Alguém pode dar alguma sugestão
@Afonso Alcântara eu assinei esse serviço pelo teste grátis mais pediu cartão só não sabia que não iria conseguir remover o pagamento ser escolhi o teste grátis porque não consigo remover a cartão meu medo é cobra assim que termina o teste grátis me ajudar pfvr
Vá em configurações de conta do Google serviços é la vc seleciona.
Como que cancela ou exclui a conta no google cloud?
Sim a ideia é essa
Otimo conteúdo, é possível criar um servidor dentro do google cloud para hospedar diversos sites ? se sim, qual solução devo utilizar?
Basta passar o login para cada uma das pessoas.
Me tira uma dúvida como funciona ter 1 maquina é 5 pessoas acessando a máquina do Google mesmo tempo ? Não sei é entendeu minha pergunta
Todos vão gerar cobrança de acordo com as configurações selecionadas.
Tenho um laboratório que vai utiliza mais de 1 máquina virtual, quantos servidores virtuais é possível criar sem gerar cobranças?
Nesse seu caso aconselho contratar um serviço de hospedagem convencional encontra de até 15r$ por mês.
@Afonso Alcântara Pois é... até tenho um plano de hospedagem na hostgator, mas gostaria de migrar meus sites pra uma vm, com mais desempenho que as hospedagens tradicionais.
Olá. Muito bom o vídeo. Uma dúvida, qual o custo médio mensal de uma maquina para apenas um sistema em wordpress? Estou com dificuldade para encontrar essa informação.
Vc precisa primeiro configurar um cartao de crédito.
@Afonso Alcântara muito obrigado, já havia confirmado meio de pagamento, até cheguei a fazer o upgrade, mas só funcionou com o com o disco fixo normal. Só restou uma dúvida quanto a forma correta de desligar o computador remoto para evitar o consumo dos créditos
Windows: olhando para o Pc a sua esquerda no canto superior tem três barras, clica nela, depois clique em &#39;faturamento&#39;, logo em seguida clica em &#39;visão geral&#39;, no canto inferior esquerdo dessa página tá escrito &#39;fazer upgrade&#39;, clica, depois clique novamente na mesma opção, logo em seguida vai nas notificações e clique em &#39;tentar novamente&#39; na notificação dizendo que n deu certo a ou crie outra.
Excelente tutorial, mas infelizmente não consigo colocar o windows server, sempre dá essa mensagem: &quot;As instâncias da VM do Windows não estão incluídas na avaliação gratuita. Para usá-los, primeiro ative o faturamento na sua conta. Você ainda poderá aplicar seus créditos de avaliação gratuita a produtos e serviços qualificados.&quot; Não sei como ultrapassar esse problema mesmo tendo conta com meio de pagamento atualizado.
Sim a ideia do servidor em nuvem é essa acesso de qualquer ponto.
Afonso. primeiro parabéns pela dicas, explanou muito bem sobre a criação. Precisava de uma ajuda sua. Tenho um servidor local na minha empresa, e abri uma filial em outra cidade. tenho um programa de terceiros, que roda no meu servidor local para venda emissão de nota e outros. nas minhas maquinas internas funciono com outros computadores como terminais que acessam esse servidor. Consigo efetuar esse mesmo processo com esse servidor em nuvem? Acessar com os meus terminais direto no servidor google, inclusive os da outra filial?
Quando acaba ele avisa que acabou é pergunta se vc quer continuar.
@Afonso Alcântara Mas ai ele não dá mais o bonus, né?
Ótimo vídeo mas faltou alguns detalhes. Aquele crédito de 300 dólares, que é dado pelo google, como é gasto aquilo? Provavelmente cada configuração tem um valor que é retirado desse crédito, né? E terminado os 12 meses, o que acontece depois disso?
Sim continua rodando no servidor
opa, me tire uma duvida, caso eu coloque um bot online nesse pc virtual, e desligar o meu pc, esse bot continua rodando la? nao precisa da minha internet?
Tenta configurar uma nova máquina algo tá errado ai
Boa noite amigo. Sempre quando eu vou acessar a máquina virtual aparece um prompit de comando do tipo C:\user/and-trindade&gt; e não sei o que fazer pra sair dessa tela pra carregar a tela virtual. Desde já Obrigado!
Da uma conferida no suporte do Google Cloud.
olhando para o Pc a sua esquerda no canto superior tem três barras, clica nela, depois clique em &#39;faturamento&#39;, logo em seguida clica em &#39;visão geral&#39;, no canto inferior esquerdo dessa página tá escrito &#39;fazer upgrade&#39;, clica, depois clique novamente na mesma opção, logo em seguida vai nas notificações e clique em &#39;tentar novamente&#39; na notificação dizendo que n deu certo a ou crie outra.
Retornando a sua resposta, já fiz várias instâncias e todas aparecem esse prompit de comando C:/user/and-trindade &gt; e não sei o que fazer. Já fiz até em outra região pra testar e nada. Se puder me ajudar agradeço. Desde já agradeço pela resposta
e agora?
Na hora de abrir, abre um prompt de comando, nao abre uma máquina
Sim pode cancelar
eu vou fazer o teste, se ao termino do teste eu não quiser mais eu posso cancelar ??? ou preciso pagar algo ??? tudo que for cobrado ele vai solicitar que eu autorize ?
Vc precisa comprar um IP fixo no Brasil pra poder configurar é fazer isso
Boa noite Afonso Alcântara, gostaria de saber se consigo obter ip externo da google cloud com localidade no Brasil, tendo em vista que mesmo os servidores localizados em São Paulo tem o ip com localização Norte Americana. Preciso que a localização seja Brasileira para criar um servidor de counter strike e aparecer na lista de outros usuários, tendo em vista que só aparece na lista ip de servidores Sul americanos. Muito Obrigado
Acredito que a máquina virtual seja diferente daquelas máquinas do Windows Machinne
Eu fiz e deu certo ..mas quando conecto um pendrive no usb meu pendrive não carrega na maquina virtual cloud..oque pode estar acontecendo..ou tenho q configurá para maquina vitual reconhecer as portas usb da minha cpu local?.se puder me ajunda fico grata..

Amigo, ainda está funcionando? Eu fiz aqui e aparece na parte que o servidor está sendo criado, uma mensagem dizendo que as instâncias bom do Windows não estão incluídas na avaliação gratuita e que para usá-las devo ativar o faturamento na minha conta(o cartão de crédito eu coloquei certinho na parte anterior)
Sim da certo tem que aprender a criar um hostweb
Posso instalar um sistema de gestão de vendas de uma loja no pc virtual? Vc aconselha ou é arriscado? Ficaria muito caro? Abç

Muita gente tem relatado isso
Alguém pode me ajudar entre em contato com o suporte do Google cloud, eu não consegui contato nem por email ou telefone. Estou tendo problema com o Google cloud
Sim e sim da certo
ola boa noite, conversando com algumas pessoas do ramo de streams descobri que varias usam chamadas maquinas virtuais pra farmar pontos nas mesmas, segundo elas essas maquinas sao onlines e o site fica online 24/7, procurei bastante mas nao sei se estou no caminho certo para saber mais sobre isso, o google cloud é uma dessas maquinas? obrigado desde ja
sim server se vc tiver uma internet boa
Serve para jogos
Kmkmkkk pqp é cada umaa
Para gastar dentro do Google cloud
esse credito é para gastar dentro do Google Cloud Platform ou pode transferir para a conta bancaria?
Sim pq roda no servidor do Google
Mas tem que configurar ou só desligar mesmo?
Se eu desligar o Pc ele continua rodando?
@Afonso Alcântara como assim? Arrasta pra onde? Como acessar a máquina &quot;normal&quot; durante o uso das VMs?
Basta criar a pasta normal depois arrastar os arquivos para dentro da VM
Alguem sabe me informar como faço o upload de alguns arquivos do computador principal (como uma pasta de imagens por exemplo) pra dentro da minha VM?
Da sim
@Afonso Alcântara queria utiliza mas n tenho cartao :/ triste
Da pra jogar games nessa maquina virtual?
Esse caso vc precisa assinar para ter as vms
Eu assinei e tive acesso,b👍👍
Bom dia, tentei criar uma vm e apareceu esta mensagem, <br />&quot;Windows VM instances are not included with the free trial. To use them, first enable billing on your account. You&#39;ll still be able to apply your free trial credits to eligible products and services.&quot; <br /> (
 As instâncias da VM do Windows não estão incluídas na avaliação gratuita. Para usá-los, primeiro ative o faturamento em sua conta. Você ainda poderá aplicar seus créditos de avaliação gratuita a produtos e serviços qualificados.)<br />Poderia me ajudar por favor, o que devo fazer?
sim por enquanto.
O bom que o inglês está 100% né kkkkk
Eu uso cartão pré pago
infelizmente não tem como fazer.
Quem não tem cartão de credito como faz?
Vc vai usar a internet deles é a sua para acessar o servidor normal como se fosse um site
Tenho uma grande dúvida, pode me ajudar? Se eu baixo algo no Google cloud, ele vai utilizar minha internet pra baixar no meu computador e depois enviar para o cloud? Ou utiliza a internet lá do serviço do Google já? Tipo, vou precisar de uma net poderosa para baixar e enviar as coisas ou só de uma net pra reproduzir a imagem na tela do meu computador?
Criar máquinas virtuais armazenar apis é muito mais
Para que serve este google cloud?
Nas configurações de pagamento da sua conta Google vc pode remover
Boa tarde amigo. Pode me ajudar com um dúvida.... Eu fiz minha conta no google Cloud e ainda não gastei o preriodo gratis e coloquei meu cartão de crédito... agora quero deletar esta conta pra não cobrar do meu cartão..... sabe como fazer isso ???? Obrigado
Sim serve para jogar games
Oloko vei, vou fica rico, comprar um windows mais barrela instalar uma maquina de última geração de 8 núcleos é fazer uma lahause kk
Peraí... e se eu usar isso pra jogar jogos pesados que meu pc da xuxa não roda?
Sim ele fica rodando servidor ligado.
alguem pode me tirar essa duvida?<br />Se eu instalar um .exe. Ele ficaria funcionando online mesmo sem eu estar logado no servidor ou quando eu saio do servidor o serviço fica desligado?
Va nas configurações da sua conta google e entre no gerenciador de pagamentos para excluir
Galera alguém pode me ajudar preciso excluir Google cloud.. por favor me ajudem...Whats 69 999730527
Serve converter videos
De quanto precisa ser minha internet
Sim da certo
@Afonso Alcântara pelo que eu vi não tem um ano ...... tem que pagar do mesmo jeito ... poderia fazer um vídeo explicando ?? Melhor pq preciso muito disso
Ele inicia um novo sistema nae??? Daria para rodar um programa que eu não consiga abrir no meu pc ???? Tipo um jogo muito pesado para o meu pc ?
Então tenta outras versões pra ver
O meu não da certo colocar o windows server. Me ajuda. Quando coloco o windws server 2012 aparece um ponto de exclamação na instancia.
Da também
@Afonso Alcântara Mas e o desempenho?
e pra jogar?
Consegui criar uma normal
@Afonso Alcântara Que estranho no meu não permitiu.
Na versão TRIAL ele não permite criar VMS.
Sim fica ligado vc será cobrado pelo tempo que ficar ligado
Bom dia amigo, ele fica 24 horas ligado mesmo sem eu estar conectado? E teria algum plano mensal ?
Nesse caso é o VM que tá bloqueada não sua máquina libera nela
Minha maquina não acessa a internet de dentro do hospedeiro =\
ótimo conteúdo top Afonso! Trabalho com Google GCP é sensacional!
Cara se vai salvar minhas lives.. pois quero fazer Streeming pela maquina virtual e jogar pelo meu PC com a net da minha casa ... você acha que vai da bom?
Depende da configuração que vc escolher
@Afonso Alcântara tipo essa do exemplo que o amigo fez. e com 200Gb de SSD
quanto custa para eu manter uma maquina desta em nuvem?
Sim memória ram
uma dúvida, aqueles 30gb de memória, seria a memória RAM da VM?
como você fez amigo?
Sim da certo só sua net tem que ser boa pra transmissões
E POSSIVEL CONSIGIRAR. PARA JOGAR GAMES PESADOS MESMO TEMDO UM PC DA XUXA
12 meses é o período
AFONSO, EU NÃO ENTENDI UMA COISA... O PERIODO DE TESTE GRATUITO, QUAL É? OS 300 DOLARES, SÓ PODEM SER USADOS DEPOIS QUE CONTRATADO O SERVIÇO?
Nesse caso só selecionar um plano maior mesmo
Afonso, estou precisando aumentar o disco dentro do google cloud. E vi que é muito fácil aumentar, mas nao vi os valores. tenho um disco de 20GB queria ter uma ideia de valor para aumentar mais 10GB por exemplo. Voce tem ideia quanto que fica para aumentar estes 10GB?
boa tarde, qual outra solução gratuita de cloud para teste durante um ano vc indica? fui criar conta e percebi q agora só dura 3 meses.
Valew espero ter ajudado
@Afonso Alcântara ajudou muito. Parabéns pelo excelente trabalho!!
MUITO OBRIGADO!!!!
Vc precisa aumentar sua velocidade de upload junto a sua operadora caso queira ir mais rápido
@Afonso Alcântara não precisa não<br />upload aqui é 15mb<br />tem muita gente reclamando do google drive falando que ele é lento
cara eu uso o google drive pra fazer bkps mas ele é muito lento pra fazer o upload, esse google cloud tem essa função? muito bom o video
o meu está dando erro dizendo que a MV está sem internet ou desligada, mas ela aparece que está ligada e não sei oq fazer
Nesse caso sempre precisa colocar faturamento para liberar os créditos promocionais
Pra mim aparece: As instâncias de VM do Windows não estão incluídas na avaliação gratuita. Para usá-los, primeiro ative o faturamento em sua conta. Você ainda poderá aplicar seus créditos de avaliação gratuita a produtos e serviços qualificados.<br />O que fazer?
olá,tudo bem?<br />amgio,meu Vm. Fica tela em preto sempre<br />o que eu faço?
Sim pode usar é uma máquina sua nos servidores do Google
uma duvida<br />essa maquina eu posso fazer oque eu quiser tipo baixa jogos e etc<br />e posso usa pra sempre? ou é so uma demo de 1 mes ou menos?<br />e qual a placa de video que ele usa?
Sim precisa ativar<br />Faturamento no entanto vc só será cobrado após usar os créditos gratuitos
As instâncias de VM do Windows não estão incluídas na avaliação gratuita. Para usá-los, primeiro ative o faturamento em sua conta. Você ainda poderá aplicar seus créditos de avaliação gratuita a produtos e serviços qualificados.
Tenta reconfigurar do zero a sua VM pode ser que vc tenha configurado algo diferente do vídeo
chefe, após montar a maquina e clicar em &quot;criar&quot; o meu status nao fica verde, nao fica disponivel, pq?
Obrigado inscreva-se no canal
Ótimo vídeo !
Em configuração de conta
boa tarde como cancela o cloud do google?
Só da pelo pc
Boa tarde<br />Uso pelo celular, não tenho pc<br />Como faço pra mandar pastas com arquivo pra dentro da VM?
Sim normal
Digamos que eu faça isso e instale um banco de dados PostgreSQL, eu posso desligar meu PC que o banco vai continuar funcionando para serem acessado de outros computadores
Excelente video, vou testar com certeza. Duas perguntinhas,<br />dá para instalar windows 10 ou só versões de windows server? além da memória ram e cpus ele tem placa de video top também?
Kk tudo tem um preço
Cara, você pode me dar certeza que se eu usar os 300 $ de créditos eu não vou ter que pagar depois? Estou com muito medo. Até porque, hj em dia, é apenas 90 dias pra gastar os créditos.
Ôh se desse para resgatar esses 1.500 reais (300 U$) Quem dera
Se tem a possibilidade de eu ter uma supermáquina com acesso remoto, as possibilidades por exemplo seriam armazenamento maior, maior velocidade de resposta em baixar vídeos, fazer uploads para o canal no youtube... é isso?
Boa noite mestre, já faz um tempinho que você fez o vídeo. Mas tenho uma duvida, hoje em 2021 eles dão a opção de ter GPU na GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM? E nessa VM posso instalar qualquer programa da plataforma windows?
Pq ele deve fazer parte dos apps que vem de pré fábrica
Esse app aparece no meu celular do nada, já desinstalei 2 x e ele volta, meu celular é Android.
esses 300 dólares eu posso pegar e utilizar para finalidade.( é só uma curiosidade)
Amigo não consegue instala windows server pois meu computador já é um windows ai não aceitou criar e botei outro sistema mas não acertei configurar , pode me ajudar?
Sim pode normal.
Posso instalar um programa pra rodar la quando meu pc estiver desligado?
Falto algumas coisas nesse video 1° mostar o gerenciador de tarefas <br />2° fazer teste de desenpenho tipo testar velocidade do ssd. Velocidade de memórias fazer um test em um progagama de benchmark para ver o desenpenho do processador<br />3° qual a velocidade da internet fazer os testes de velocidade de internet <br />4° quanto custa esse servidor da de desabilitar ele por exemplo colocar ele para funcionar só por um periodo

Bagaimana kabarnya pak dhika? ...
Wuihh
@kupangjc apaka firebase termasuk google cloud apa tidak mas?
Beda Google Drive focusnya hanya di storage service, sedangkan Google Cloud lebih luas meliputi computing, database, storage dst
@Indra Aang nope, firebase terkhusus untuk storing data, tapi pemrosesannya memanfaatkan gcp untuk akses data, salah satunya GCF(google cloud function) ini pake node js untuk mengakses function firebase berbentuk API
Lebih baik google cloud atau google Drive?
Pricingnya gimana ya gan
@Bryan Dev tergantung lokasi data center, resource yang digunakan: jumlah core CPU, RAM, storage dst. Lihat pricing calculatornya di sini: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator">https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator</a>
@kupangjc wah compute engine nya mahal juga yah pdhl syaa cumn pakai 1 instance small. Bisa 17$/bulan.
Udah pake fitur apa aja dan deploy apa bang ?
@Dzikriyana saya pakai vm instances nya atau lebih di kenal vps. Make os ubuntu server 20.04 buat deploy aplikasi web nodejs+mongodb
@Bryan Dev Mantap bang sudah cukup lama ya pakainya sepertinya. Saya masih meraba-raba fiturnya gcp minggu lalu cobain deploy app simple python pake ubuntu juga.
GCP keren. Saya sudah coba 4 bulan. Fitur lengkap mau untuk untuk projek apa saja bisa.😁
Fix. Konten WPU LEVEL UP!
pake Jenius BTPN saja, bisa
Wah, sangat excited sama pembahasan ini , terima kasih pak dhika
Sedih karna gak punya kartu kredit jadi sulit untuk mencoba google cloud . 😟
Ada Notif...<br />&quot;Wah tentang Google Cloud Platform&quot;<br />Auto nonton
mantap pak
terima kasih pak, sangat tercerahkan
Saya sudah lihat yahoo,, lalu saya apakan bang?
@Indra Wijaya kayaknya cuman nyuruh liat doang bang :D
anda dapet apa nyuru liat yahoo?
Keren banget. Inilah kenapa google umur panjang krna relevan dengan zaman. Coba liat yahoo
Wah trial saya sudah habis ..

Setuju
Setuju
Boleh banget nih
wkwkwk mati yang jualan hosting dll di Indo.. apalagi kalau di tambahin logic, yang pasang hosting di google seonya lebih di tarik sama google index
setuju
Not sure if anyone gives a damn but I just hacked my gfs Instagram password using Instaplekt. Cant link here so search for it on google enjoy!
setuju
Setuju banget tuh<br />step-stepnya dari awal smpai online..hehehe
setujuuu
@Afrizal Hidayat disetiap teknologi yg sudah ada nantinya pasti ada yg baru lagi, sudah resiko😆
@Afrizal Hidayat ga mati pak, kalau udah tau harganya pasti bakal beli hosting yang sudah jadi😂<br />Kecuali kalau emang niat bikin vps hosting
Next : WPU bikin cara buat Server Hosting sendiri dengan Google Cloud 😅
Wow mantap
Deploy deploy deploy
@Dzikriyana bisa bwat machine learning jga yah kalo yg alibaba
Alibaba juga murah wkwkwk free trial buat coba2 dikasih 1 tahun mantap vps nya doang mayan.
@stifen jans Gcp juga bisa gan TensorFlow, malah saya baca-baca di forum katanya bagusan fitur dari gcp kalo buat ML sama AI.
HETZNER Cloud computing paling murah bro, syangnya masih IP Jerman sama Finland doang
Mahal, sama ama AWS tidak cocok untuk ukm , Huawei barusan bongkar pasar 😂
Mantul n8
Setuju
setuju
Pakai kartu debit, Kang
Pake visa debit kan bisa? Kaya punya jenius
Mungkin bisa ditambahin gopay grab pay uber pay ovo wkwkwk
jenius bisa jadi alternatif
pakai debit sekarang udah banyak yang bisa kok mas. Barusan saya pake bca expresi aja bisa buat ambil trial
up
Ya.. setuju sekali
yup setuju
Setuju sih, apalagi yang pelajar &amp; mahasiswa biar ga terlalu ribet masalah payment, semoga kedepannya ada opsi pembayaran via transfer bank biasa atau semacam ovo gopay deh juga boleh
Pake jenius bisa ka
pake jenius bang
Setuju
Indo Pride caranya gimana?
byr transfer di indomart dong
betul sekali, orang indonesia jarang yang pake kartu kredit.Banyak juga yang ingin pake layanan ini tapi terbentur kartu credit. karena di indonesia banyak yang anti kartu kredit.. ( kartu kredit = hutang = tidak di rekomendasikan dalam agama tertentu )
Kartu debit yang bisa dipakai sebagai kartu kredit:<br>- Jenius. Ini yang paling fleksibel, bisa nambah kartu dan gonta-ganti kartu sesuka kita<br>- ATM BCA baru yang sudah diaktifkan fitur ecommerce-nya
gopay gitu contohnya ya? kwkwk
@Den Bruno bener sih tp klo orang gk punya Jenius?
Setuju 1000% zenpasento
@Dimas Hayat Pratama kok gw blm ya
via Gopay aja enk 🤣
iya nih betul, credit card biasanya dipake kaum menengah ke atas, sedangkan konsumen di indonesia kebanyakan menengah ke bawah
Iyaa betul mas. Saya pakai Jenius waktu register API Google Maps yg udah gak gratis lagi waktu itu. Tinggal bikin virtual debit aja di card center Jenius, trus kita taruh saldo secukupnya disana untuk payment ke Google. Udah deh, ntar kita tinggal pantau aja. Malahan di Jenius ada notifikasi &amp; e-mail klo payment kita ditarik sama Google. Klo udah abis saldonya tinggal isi saldo lagi ke virtual. Nah praktis, enak g perlu bayar biaya servis kartu kredit.
saya berhasil pakek ATM BcA yg gold pak
@Rahmad Mukti Terima kasih atas rekomendasinya. Saya coba cek Jenius
@Indo Pride oh ini maksudnya ATM BCA yang ada logo mastercard-nya gitu?
@soraa UP
Setuju
Kaya yang mau beli aja lah🤣
Usul ke Google Cloud Indonesia agar pembayaran jangan hanya via Credit Card. Saya termasuk yang ogah pakai CC (personal reasons). Kalau punya opsi lain untuk pembayaran akan sangat membantu saya dan klien. Thanks.
Apa daya otak gak bisa kerja sama hehehe
Wadaw pusing ini, fiturnya bayak banget soalnya. Saya juga sampai ambil free course hehehe.
Bahas Firebase dan dalemannya, pak.. Firestore, Storage, Hosting, Function, ML, FCM, dll..
Pak, mohon respon pak, saya mau buat multi level pada program Web boostrap, php PDO, selalu gagal, enggak bisa multi user, setiap login semuanya masuk kehalaman utama, si Web nya enggak bisa ngebaca mana user mana admin. Kira kira dimana masalahnya pak,
Kalo mau bikin vps harus pake server bare metal, corporate itu yang sanggup. Mending pakai yang sudah ada kaya yang banyak di jual indo atau pakai free trial dari alibaba 1 tahun. Udah cukup kalo buat bangun server minecraft.
@Dzikriyana ya namanya belajar buat sendiri, dari pad beli
Pak plisss buat seri cara membuat vps server kita sendiri, server minecraft. Vps
Ibaratnya seperti hardisk online yang kita akses mudah atau data ber giga giga dalam mengolah database
@Robinson Tamba kaya google drive dong..<br />Sumpah masih blm ngerti fungsi google cloud
@muhammad luthfi Bilqisti google drive beda dengan cloud kalau google drive cuma lihat berkas saja gk bisa jalankan program distu sedangkan google cloud program yang kita simpan cloud dapat berjalan 24 nonstop di server google .bahkan media penyimpananya bisa akses sampai berterra terra tanpa kendala
pa dika cobain google cloud, biar kita tau apaan sih google cloud itu secara teknis hehee...

Emang mau buat apa daftar Google cloud?
@Satria ya bukan gimana-gimana, dia kata masih SMP.<br /><br />Saya agak skeptis, umur segitu sudah mau mencoba Google cloud. Kalau memang sudah paham apa gunanya Google cloud sih, ok saja.<br /><br />Kalau nggak tahu? Bisa bermasalah nanti. Secara Google cloud pembayaran nya pakai kartu kredit.<br /><br />Jika tidak bijak, bisa buat hutang dengan jumlah besar. Apalagi Google cloud itu pakai dolar, dan mahal. Dia masih SMP, gimana itu?
@Satria Dilihat dari sisi biaya, Google cloud itu mahal.<br /><br />Dan saya bertanya-tanya, anak SMP main Google cloud itu buat apa.<br /><br />Jika mau ingin tahu website, aplikasi dan sebagainya, mending hosting lokal aja. Biaya masih murah.<br /><br />Kalau memang dianya siap dana besar, istilah kasarnya, uang tidak jadi pertimbangan, sok atuh, daftar Google cloud.<br /><br />Secara Google cloud emang bagus untuk jadi pembelajaran. Semacam investasi pengetahuan untuk kedepannya.<br /><br />Siapa tahu, saat sudah dewasa dia mau bangun perusahaan dan membutuhkan pusat data.
@Simbah Online untuk informasi saja, saya memang masih SMP tetapi saya sudah lumayan menguasai front end dan back end web development, saya membutuhkan vps yang kencang dan proper untuk project e-learning saya, jadi tidak ada salahnya dong jika saya menggunakan google cloud platform. Salam, Yuke Brilliant H.
Dan jangan lupa &quot;Learning Beyond Limits&quot;
Saya masih smp dan saya dan keluarga tidak mempunyai kartu kredit, bagaimana dong?
mantaaapp!! sponsor yyeeuhhh,, maju terus WPU
setuju

Pak.Dika<br />Next : Tutorial penggunaan google cloud nya pak🙏
Buat nyepam bang? :v
@Nanang Joko Susanto ga bang, becanda hehe.. GCloud ga open port 25, tapi kalo buat install WHM tetep bisa pake vps Centos. Kalo saya pengguna Hetzner lebih murah.
iyai bs bikin vps sendiri. jd bs belajar dr step paling awal
@Wahyu Utomo Mau bikin saas - software as service. Emang bisa server google buat nyepam? Kan emailnya terintegrasi sama gmail dan sudah pasti ada batasan send/hour nya
@Wahyu Utomo Gitu ya.. coba menuju tkp hehe
Google Cloud apakah bisa di install WHM dan cPanel ga ya?
dimana info pelatihanya bang ? bisa dishare kah?<br />online course ?

bisa dijelasin kelebihannya gcp dimana dibanding aws? mau milih cloud provider nih soalnya
Google cloud platform &gt; AWS 👀
Pake jenius BTPN bisa ko
tetap aja mesti pakai CC, kirain dah pakai payment dari indonesia

Bang bikin tutorial nya dong, gw dah coba hosting di hostingan gratis tapi lalot banget malah bikin kesel
smoga kang sandhika makinnnnnn berlimpah berkahhh karna slalu berbagi ilmu pengetahuan buat banyakkkk orang lain.
iya mahal bed
Brapaan?
@abraham ok mas, makasih infonya
Iya agak mahal. Tapi karena masih baru mudah-mudahan kedepannya harganya tidak terlalu mahal.
@Stevi Septiana saya custom sekitar $3.xx perbulan buat runing CHR, sama saya ambil yang $14.xx perbulan buat run aplikasi saya.<br />Beda beda tergantung spek yang dibuat sih
@Mursidin Yunus masih baru? Lah gcp kan udah lama pak udah sejak 2008🤦‍♂️
Udah test, dan hasilnya mantap. Tapi harganya juga MANTAP
Pak Sandi, boleh tolong dibahas aplikasi outsystems donk
Usul mas dhika, nnti buat tutorial menggunakan GCP. <br /><br />Yang setuju lik donk🥰
Gud info
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fyi">#FYI</a> aja, bukan endorse wkwk<br />Kartu kredit bisa diganti pake jenius kok. Bikinnya gampang
Kang bikinin playlist reactjs dong kang,lagi naik kayanya reactjs

Bener banget ini local payment penting banget semoga kedepan segera ada
@LOOK INSIDE ya, dan berbasis debet, bukan kartu kredit. Tokh debet juga jelas koq data2nyq, dan terlebih lagi, dananya dijamin Ada, plus terhindar Dari individual debt trap.
Bu mega, klien gcp besar di Indokan BRI. Jalan masuknya tinggal &quot;kliklah&quot; bikin payment enable dari bank lokal. Saya yakin kios juice pun bisa jadi klien gcp. Serius. Mereka bisa berbondong2 go digital pake platform Google. We are Indonesian trust Google more koq, sebelum keduluan &quot;tetangga sebelah&quot; yg usaha keras, cuman Blum dapet clue bahwa payment channel non lokal Di indo itu &quot;gembok besar&quot; masuk ke cloud platform. <br />Btw, thx dah buka region local Di sini. It will be massive. Let see. Cmiww.
yg butuh google cloud bisa DM :v

pak shandika bagaimana cara streaming live seperti itu ?
Sama mas, issuenya emang kayaknya firewall indihome (sometime) keblokir,test pake jaringan gsm mas, jangan telkomsel sama keblokir juga
@Rizky Budiansyah kalo saya ganti gsm indosat lgsg bisa, soalnya dr pihak hostingannya ga selesai2 masalah issue kyk gini, tapi mungkin catetan nih buat saya kalo hubungin mereka coba suruh cek ip saya ke black list atau nggak
@Rival Putra masalh saya udh clear bro, ternyata ip kita ke blcklist di sistem web hostingnya, untung admin hosting saya baik, jadi skrng udh bisa lagi, coba tanyain bro lu ke admin yng lu pake hostingnya biar ipnya di whitelst
mas saya mau nanya, kenapa ya web saya kalau pakai jaringan wifi indihome itu gk bisa dibuka, tpi kalau pake jaringan yang lain webnya bisa dibuka, apakah domain pengaruh? domain saya <a href="http://my.id/">my.id</a>

Abizz itu DO
Sekarang GCP, Besok2 AWS, AZURE, ALIBABA Cloud
AWS?
Salah satunya, selain itu ada fitur untuk AI, data science, data engineer, dev mobile juga ada
Google cloud = hardisk online untk olah data secara online dua akses client penggunajasa dan server (penguna cluod seperti perusahaan startup, web hosting dll)
google cloud itu intinya penyedia web hosting ya?
kata siapa, custom lagi lah
@Ahmad Ansori cara customnya gimana? aku butuh aplikasi aku + ms sql
kita bisa install aplikasi windows 10 , lalu running disana gak ya? kalau azure cuma aplikasi yang ada di microsoft store doang...gak bisa aplikasi kita sendiri
Daftar pake zenius bisa gan
Kalau ngk ada kartu kredit, gmn cara daftar nya
Makasih mas sandhika penyampaian nya bagus banget
Sekalinya yg masuk monster 🤣
Nanti kalau ada trouble malah disuruh restart server
Ahirnya tergerus juga :&#39;V sangat disayangkan harusnya telkomsel ikut bersaing di cloud seperti yg dikatakan Pak Eric

Bang Dhika, tolong dong bahas tentang sisi komersil pembuatan web. Harga pembuatan web itu berapa sih? Soalnya banyak sekali yg menyediakan jasa pembuatan web murah bener. Jadi terasa bias pak, belajar coding nya susah tapi harga yang di dpt terasa ga worth. 🙏🙏🙏

Nah saya ikut event juara GCP dulu, kalo bisa menyelesaikan quest nya dapet baju atay jaket.<br /><br />Tapi sampai sekarang gak datang dateng barang nya 🙄<br /><br />Padahal udah lebih dari minimal yang harus diselesaikan
Sayang, aws masih belum launch jakarta datacenter
berarti bisa ya pak, kalau semisalnya kita pengen belajar linux server ataupun windows server, tapi kita gak ada perangkat yang mumpuni dalam menambah pengetahuan kita di bidang sysadmin ?
Mau nanya dong, kok gw dikirimin email pajak make Google Cloud ya? Yg lain gitu juga gak?? Gw udah setahun sih make GCP, dapet kredit gratis 4jt++ kan. Setaun dipake buat deploy web client di GCS sama bikin VM Instance.Skg udah abis sih creditnya karna udah lebih dr setaun juga..

Permisi pak Sandhika saya mau daftar google Cloud apakah aman gak yah pakai kartu kredit? Serius nanya🙏🏻
lebih simple AWS drpd GCP
GCP ini sama kyk AWS Cloud ya? services-nya jg 11 12 😅
Wah mantab kang.. Makasih banyak
dibanding aws, bagusan mana?
harga bandwithnya mahal banget, gak bisa buat VPN, ngeriihh :D pake yg free bolehlah kredit dapet 4jt++
@Silver Klo untuk trafik Indonesia, bagus gcp lah karena data centernya udah di jakarta, aws klo ga salah belum punya data center disini.
Gw cuma perlu VPS, kemaren2, karena ada gratisan dari Google Cloud, gw nyobain yg servernya di jakarta.<br /><br />Setelah bbrp minggu, kesimpulannya, tidak ada keunggulan yg significant dari segi kecepatan dibanding VPS lainnya, tapi harga kira2 3x lipat lebih mahal.<br /><br />Ntar setelah gratisannya abis, balik lg deh ke VPS biasa.
Terimakasih Bang Ilmunya
kebetulan lagi belajar tentang google cloud platform.<br />terima kasih buat pemerintah yg adain digitalent.<br />bisa belajar google cloud gratis.
pertanyaan dari orang awam nih pak : jadi ini kaya Google Stadia gitu gasih? masih bingung
Ini dia om panutan gw
Kyknya bulan berikutnya bakal bayar bukan gratis lagi
@holil haqalim @holil haqalim jika habis 12 bulan free.. slanjutnya utk perbayarnya ada pemberitahuan oleh pihak Google gk Bang???<br />Atau di tagih paksa gk Bang. dan atau tiba -tiba rekening langsung terpotong ???.<br />Mohon penjelasannya, terimakasih
Bang register di GoogleCloud minta alamat sama kredit card . Ini gratis 12 bulan. Nanti habis 12 bulan, di tagih sama pihak Google suru bayar gk ,Bang???

Jadi Google Cloud baru permintaan Swasta ya ?<br />Waow..<br />Kesempatan sekali bagi para Programmer² pemberian Bug²..<br />Wkwkwk..
Saya suka banget google cloud platform hasil baca2 dan kata orang2 keren banget fiturnya, terus pernah mau coba karena ga punya credit card, saya pake vcn bni yang biasa saya pake buat isi saldo atau checkout via paypal dan ternyata tidak bisa langsung dianggap fraud jadi kaya kena banned gitu ga bisa menggunakan google cloud platform lagi
OOT but ga banget sih.. jika sudah pernah pakai or at least coba (trial) layanan google cloud platform pasti tahu saat ingin menggunakan google map api. Bahwa lokasi perangkat didapatkan dari &quot;cell tower &amp; wifi node&quot;..<br />so.. ga ada satelit.
Maaf pak, kalau mau teknologi dapat dimanfaatkan secara menyeluruh di indonesia maka jaringan harus di ratakan dulu, karena di indonesia timur jaringannya belum merata

Yang saya lihat fitur-fiturnya biasa saja, standard cloud service lainnya seperti Amazon, IBM, dll. Mungkin saya ada yang tidak aware atau miss, so my question is : Why Google Cloud?
Sebenarnya yg paling kami butuhkan di daerah adalah signal network yg ketersediannya hanya wilayah perkotaan saja dimana memenuhi standar kecepatan bandwich dan harga berlangganan yg lebih murah
Kena PPN?
Keren kontennya bang, semakin terdepan 👍

How to load dataset into notebook
I agree
I think among all the cloud vendors, GCP&#39;s UI is the best
I really like the service, I really do, but the UI is a mess, some services sound and do very similar things and worst of all: doesn&#39;t have native dark mode.
Do you have working coupon code?
Probably through image editing
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtUIQz_EkUw&amp;t=3m05s">3:05</a> how does he grayscale the images (clock and cloud)? Please anyone?
Good approach explanation. Like the guy&#39;s way
cant believe they played reggaeton at the end hahahahaha
As a student, how can we have the billing account in Google Cloud Platform as education grants?
but GCP is cheap ...
GCP is easier to use bro, for a person who is new to this stuff
How?
apoorw anand or you can watch closely aws&#39;s clients migrate to gcp soon
Lot of Clients are moving from aws to gcp here in the USA. Gcp is flexible and the analytics and ease of use are very helpful
I don’t know. Google is cheap and their VMs are fairly fast.
S.G HARSH if you plan a good artitecture for your application then AWS is also cheaper.
AWS is much better than GCP

&quot;Buzzword&quot; is a buzzword. I hate it, stop using it, plz...
Good
Only me only my compagnie
Loved the presentation and learned a lots from this video. I hope people could do more with this powerful tool. Sometimes i think how is individuals and company use their credit in their working projects?
No one is forcing you to watch this video Dude
Exactly, click off the video if your not interested
@FU DU but he is telling the truth
I think those business use case examples and the history was a bit insightful and useful
this is for students looking to understand GCP and why it is useful. some like to read about it, some like to see a presentation/demo about it. All this information and you keep looking in the wrong places
I would rather google for what is GCP than watch a 45 minutes of self promotion. All that innovation and you keep wasting my time.
there is an option for auto scaling, this is just an introduction, if you want to learn more, you should watch other advanced tutorials. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfbEwfYjKl4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfbEwfYjKl4</a>
so, where is the auto scaling stuff like the coca cola guys ?
wow, the GCP is powerful
Yes, the students could use it for free. if they have Indetification Card &amp; Scan of your Credit Card. I don&#39;t think a students own credit cards, especially in the developed country.. there&#39;s no way students could use GCP for research purposes
I hope google support a bill GCP accept for education purpose, for poor students as me. THANKS SO!
It would be nice to use some small business examples. It is not clear who the target market/audience is really. I know it is for developers but developers developing what tools for who?
Where i can get that coupon code ??
He elaborate really well. Thanks a lot
Awesome dude..
Aws is better then gcp

good catch
We have a Xerox Holmes over here
Haha, good catch. I&#39;m betting these guys at spotify and CocaCola didn&#39;t have the DECENCY to call the google crews to record them while they were sleep deprived to meet some impossible deadlines, instead they record this whole thing months after, and just used some studio non-compromising boards to fill in the gaps in the narrative.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtUIQz_EkUw&amp;t=12m34s">12:34</a> the board says: Cloud Storage and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtUIQz_EkUw&amp;t=12m36s">12:36</a> &quot;Global Trigger&quot;, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtUIQz_EkUw&amp;t=12m55s">12:55</a> &quot;Scale&quot; (Cocacola); also <br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtUIQz_EkUw&amp;t=15m12s">15:12</a> &quot;Cloud Storage&quot; and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtUIQz_EkUw&amp;t=15m13s">15:13</a> &quot;Global Trigger&quot; , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtUIQz_EkUw&amp;t=15m27s">15:27</a> &quot;Scale&quot; (Spotify)..... soooo, they share the same boards? x)

Azure ftw
it will be deleted like when you format your computer, So you will need to back up your stuff before deleting the instance. Students use it to test their codes and not for writing the code directly.
The philosophy of Cloud Computing is to separate storage and compute power so that you can turn on and off the computing power as and when you need it. So it is advisable to use cloud storage to store your code and spin up a compute instance, use it and turn it off and persist data in cloud storage and connect to cloud storage again when you need to spin up another compute instance. With an amazing Petabyte scale bidirectional network, this does not take too much time.
What about the project or code written a VM and then deleted the VM will the code remains on the system ?
Coupon code has not been working..

A big wast of time in my life...
Very good presentation by Arman. Covered the basics that I really wanted to know. Also covered some good demos on using GCP. The only thing I wish was covered was about the different components or services that make up GCP in a bit more depth like compute, storage, network etc. But overall a good presentation by Arman. Would love to see more presentations from him.
Thank you :)
you are the best
Danke
I should have read the comments first

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtUIQz_EkUw&amp;t=7m56s">7:56</a> as he said &quot;pay Google&quot; my assistant went on 😂
And he&#39;s using macbook :p
The Apple logo to the top left corner of the screen should have been blurred out since the logo on the laptop was taped. Unfair.
Hahah I&#39;ve been using this for so long now
Nice
@Aviral even in microsoft people use mac
He used mac !😂😂😂
Wow it feels like yesterday when Arman was going over the wonderful things GCP is doing. Was great attending this wonderful conference!
It works for some private banks like HSBC, ICICI<br />Try switching bank account, as some bank doesn&#39;t support recurring payments.
For months I had this problem. My app was growing but I couldn&#39;t setup billing. I tried several debit cards. Finally, I reached out to Google&#39;s support team and they said that they only accept credit cards in India.
Wait, what!? Only accepts credit cards from India?
If you are in India, this long talking is useless for you. I use app engine for my project. The problem is in India and we have chip based debit card and which Google doesn&#39;t verify. And also they don&#39;t have other options like verify bank account directly. So I highly recommend you to go to your bank and ask them for a international card before starting out. Rest of the things are mentioned in the docs. And the problem you will face is not mentioned here and neither in the docs. So good luck
Hell of a point 🤣
Exactly!!
Yep
@Dharmaraj no I tried..
Right bro 😂
@Dharmaraj they only accept mater and visa cards
They do now
@ASHISH KUMAWAT are you talking specifically for education credits?? Idk that, I used my card an n got $300
@Abhishek Shrivastav Yes MasterCard is accepted. But I guess majority of the card should be MasterCard or Visa. Old Maestro cards got replaced by MasterCard too in many banks
Even the SBI Classic Debit Card is accepted
Seriously
They do. It has to be Visa or Mastercard.
Sahi baat
True!!
First of all start accepting Indian debit cards!!
What&#39;s the meaning of hiding Apple logo when you an clearly see he&#39;s using macOS? pretty dumb I would say
thanks
I&#39;ll save you an hour of your life, it&#39;s just like AWS...
hi, Am new to this platform..this looks interesting. Want to know more about Cloud? How this can help me...
In my opinion, the 3 of them will share the market. I found GCP to be the cheapest one (and probably the easiest one to use), AWS has more or less the same services but a little more expensive. Azure is way to expensive for my projects but it is a great solution for many big enterprises as well.
what is current statistics in Cloud market? AWS -&gt; Azure -&gt; and now GCP... Where is current market going and what is in next 2-3 years? Any idea?
Why the coke and Spotify commercials.?
Thanks. Very insightful
This is super helpful! I hope Google will do more student led presentation. I think many Google youtube presentation assumes a level of sophistication and experience that new users may not have. The presenter brings it down to the right level of context. Thx
Can we use a virtual machine to mine any digital crypto currency?
I have a month salary debt because Google cloud. I have no interest on it and somehow i was billed for it. Heck... the very first time i ever heard about GCP was in my credit card bill... i’ve been trying to reach out to Google, but i can only talk to the selling team.. i’ve filled all the online forms they trew on me, and got nothing. It have been two months already and i can only talk to machines about it and they evetually ignore me. GOOGLE!!! GIVE MY MONEY BACK!!!
Noone knows
- It&#39;s more like a joke I don&#39;t want anyone to clap to.<br />- OK then. You sure you wanna say it?<br />- How does it compare to AWS?<br />- What was that?<br />- AWS!<br />- What about ... Oh?! Not gonna repeat that one!!
What was the second joke?
Can you share the slide please ?
My Google Home is awake up while he is speaking! 🤣🤣

is codelabs available for all?
One suggestion-: If you want to write any code on virtual machine you can use any online IDE .You don&#39;t need to buy any cloud service for that the heavy code which you write will work on that website API. If I am wrong then tell me🙏🙏

Exactly the sort of intro video I was looking for after wasting hours online on the nitty gritty details in the official documentation
How to get the coupon code as a student?
How can I understand this cloud?
Is it Google cloud need double storage like Google drive storage and One drive from Microsoft? Coordination under One platform like Gsuite must improve the produktivity and save users money to a single cloud storage only. Same like apps like Microsoft offices 365 and Google drive with the same function for word processing, spreedsheeth anda power point etc. Owned or users should get info to save the money and at the same time we get batter system and better efficency.
Amazingly delivered!
How can I connect with a mentor
So cloud can be simplified like this 🔥🔥🔥<br /><br />👍👍👍 Thumbs-up To guy
Excellent presentation Arman
Excellent presentation - the Twilio example should have mentioned &quot;Communication Platform as a service&quot;. Would like to see a more detailed video
I feel you for sure
I watch this in 2020.
Very good session.
I’m a forever learner, thanks for the tips! Keep up the great work Arman 🙏🌟
You&#39;re amazing Arman !
What is Cloud?<br />Me: Cloud Strife :D
best one that explained the cloud concept without complications
This is one of the best technical presentation I have ever watched, completed watching full presentation without a single fast forward 👏
The huge headache in scaling with a server in the closet back in the 90’s: hiring the guy to keep them running properly when your server needed downtime…
I dont like Google
Being that you are using a Google product, will it help in your SEO?<br />Also, there’s a good reason it’s cheap, depending on how many people visit your site, Google can extract a lot of data from people that visit your site, and of course sell it. A lot of people don’t care but I do.
I&#39;m a linux noob, and completely unfamiliar with everything you&#39;ve touched on here but I followed along and got a website working basically for free. Thanks so much!
Thank you! Now I can setup my small projects live :D &lt;3
You should use HTTP auth to allow the wordpress setup ( bots can do the setup, download a backdoor and reset the setup) and before seting the password setup HTTPS, that&#39;s why these kids get hacked come on you know better!
nice video, you said cents for a year, but . . . the price for a month is around $4.68 as it is showing next to instance name when you create it, so . . . how is that?
Waaaoo following from Cameroon, West Africa

Are you tired of paying for hosting? Then pay!
For people who are not tech savvy, this is great, it opens new opportunities for us that we did not know about. Keep up the good work for the noobs please.
Great tutorial, I plan to do it this weekend.
With Elementor and woo commerce, look for store and e-commerce on YouTube.
Christmas I wondering how do you add a shop on website does wp allow it
at first i was upset cuz i just bought 4 years of hostinger web hosting for $139. then i watched 5 mins of this video and read a few comments. i&#39;m glad i didn&#39;t attempt this coding/server stuff. and i&#39;m happy w/ what i paid!!! yikes. some things are just better to pay for. for example i&#39;d rather pay somebody a couple hundred bucks to fix my car than spend 6 months learning how an engine works and fix it myself lol. i just need to drive, not get a degree in mech eng. i just need a site, not a phd in comp sci lol i&#39;m sure the tutorial is helpful for those interested tho, not knocking it, just not for me lol
Free for first 12 months then they start charging you a crazy amount. Not worth it long term. Same business model as AWS.
What is the catch here? I dont see any FREE!
You speak very nice french.
Linux!! Ain&#39;t that beautiful??
This still work? 08/2020
Is this manual install better than installing WordPress (Bitnami or Click-to-Deploy) form their marketplace?
For those working with this have trouble with the GRANT, mysql in the latest versions do not allow for the implicit user creation any longer. the commands must be split, and the user requires a domain now. so his example would be:<br /><br />CREATE USER &#39;wordpressuser&#39;@&#39;localhost&#39; IDENTIFIED BY &#39;Secure1234!&#39;;<br /><br />Then<br /><br />GRANT ALL ON wordpress.* TO &#39;wordpressuser&#39;@&#39;localhost&#39;;<br /><br />I hope this helps...
If you&#39;re using WordPress there are some plugings for that.
Hello Chris, I follow every step, i don&#39;t know anything about computers, but i still managed to make it work. Your are the best!<br />I would like to know how to SSL this machine that we just created.<br />Thanks!!
Outstanding information tutorial sharing!!!! keep it up sir, your information as absolutely nice, ats really appreciating, Thanks a lllottttttttt!!!!!!!!!!!!👍👍👍👍💓💓💓🎯💓
cool. followed your instructions right up to installing lamp-server, where after typing this, nothing happened.
You can Stop this video in any time, and this guy will always have a funny face....
Hi
Haha, @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIJdypOqlL4&amp;t=1m56s">1:56</a> I think you were about to say “web hoaxing companies” :)
If you edit your description with the time stamps with the first one as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIJdypOqlL4&amp;t=0m00s">0:00</a> instead of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIJdypOqlL4&amp;t=00m00s">00:00</a>, then you’ll activate the chapters feature.
You could simplify and automate this process a lot with Docker. Also in some cases serverless services like cloud functions and clour run can be easier and cheaper.
Chris Titus, genius play!
Chris, sorry but while I enjoyed the role Google played in the early days, they simply dig into your browsing too much now. My the time Ive finished this comment, I expect a response from google to the content, I get ads on every site i visit after viewing a product. If we applied the TikTok response to google, it would be banned outside USA and every country would secure its own browser business to ensure its citizens data is not being kept by another, all I can say its disgusting that they follow your every move on the web.
Does this still apply Chris?
I am dead in the middle of the configuration and I don&#39;t know how to open a file in root. Help.
So, this is my 5th attempt. Why will it not locate my PHP file? It keeps saying no such file.
You were in the wrong directory after changing to root?
Everything else worked smoothly afte it took me 3 hours to ficuare out how to open the apache conf file.
Chris, this was great. Thank you much. Do you have information on setting up https using a load balancer? Unless you have a certificate I don&#39;t think you can use htpps and your username/password will be transferred in clear text.
Iam watching this at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIJdypOqlL4&amp;t=00m26s">00:26</a>. Let me sleep please
use google. lol no thanks
dude you are awesome! this is truly how cool engineers make tutorials.
Sweet! Like yr saying, I was using Digital Ocean, <br />but DO is probably using THIS! and just charging <br />ME for it! Nice Vid!
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE REGISTERING OR TRY ANYTHING IN GCP AS SHOWN IN THE VIDEO<br />Firts things first, nothing is for free. NOTHING. And if it is &quot;free for real&quot;, you are product, and your data, be aware.<br />If you are watching this in nearly Sep 2020, and trying to create a Wordpress instance or install an Ubuntu Server as Chris Titus advice, you will be charged: Ubuntu Trusty
 : Canonical Cost estimated: 25,95 usd/mo so be extra careful and trust no one claiming free solutions. You are welcome.
Does this deal come with an SSL certificate?
Thanks alot but is it possible for you to help me make website remotely for our church thanks.
Yeah I wish I tried it a year ago. I remember another youtuber saying it too, back then.
Dude- I think You just changed my life. Very impressive (new linux/VPS guy here!) <del>Subbed! --</del> Turns out the free-tier program is a little different now. They charge $0.40 per month persistent disk (10gb). The First 720 hours are free, and give you 90 days to consume $300+ of credits. So. This will definitely cost something per month. Your tutorial is awesome, but I do feel a little mislead about the true costs... Perhaps google changed the program in the last 1 year!<br />Thank you for your efforts and excellent tutorial.
300$ for 90 days
Its not free now, boss...
Hi Chris, Thank you! This video really helped me! I was able to host 2 website in GCP :) by the way do I really need to install cPanel in GCP? Hope you notice this :) Thank you so much and more power!
for sure not free so read what they say about that before you agree and add your credit card. My first clue was the button says &quot;Get started for free&quot; as they always do when it will start charging later.
instructions unclear I installed Ubuntu on my credit card. Please clarify.
Hey Chris I have used 22.5/35 GB of my root directory Drive, Will this method work on my laptop or I need to reinstall Linux with bigger Root drive? Will I face any issues in the current Drive - Pop Os user
Hey did you use the google cloud platform and does this low cost method still work
Thanks so much chris, weird how im watching this video 2 days before renewing my yearly hosting xD
Do you have other good and easy options for watching your video. Then Youtube?<br />After Youtube closure of Danish music on their platform.<br />So, I want to support this platform as little as possible, and would therefore like to see your videos elsewhere.<br />The alternative, in the long run, is that I find other things to see.
Which linux distro are you using¿
I tried this and had no idea what I was doing. My site was way faster, but every time there was an error on the site that stopped me from logging in, I had no idea how to fix it. I&#39;m going back to safety in managed hosting. Maybe managed cloud hosting - who knows. But you&#39;ve got to have some expertise before doing this.
NO longer a Year, just 90 days...
this is not FREE as you stated!
These videos really help me understand a bit and later fall asleep...maybe in the future I may understand it better but I will keep trying to learn
except the first thing I had to agree to said that business use is not allowed?
@imajeff Smith I got charged twice on GCP from my debit card and had to chat with their team and took a month to return the money, I agree their services are very good but they are intended for companies not tinkerers
@Anil yeah I wish Chris made it clear what it said when he signed up which made it free for him. He should warm in the video to always read what you&#39;re agreeing to.
@imajeff Smith No actually he should have said only certain server locations and settings only give free access and unknowingly changing them may result in billing
@Anil so is there a way to know exactly what to choose?
@imajeff Smith yes there are some articles on this on GCP
Warning ⚠️ It not free nor cheap ..<br />It&#39;s for buisness, so do not proceed if you don&#39;t have enough traffic into your website or you created it for fun and learning ...
Uploads of images is not going to work unless you run this command<br />chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/*<br />as detailed here<br /><a href="https://christitus.com/wordpress-google-cloud-platform/">https://christitus.com/wordpress-google-cloud-platform/</a><br />under the Troubleshooting comments.<br />I was struggling to get it all working and eventually found this which fixed the impossible to upload problem.
wordpress ads still exist though or?
But, Google can censor my site or not?
Great video! Thank you!
It shows 4.68$ PER MONTH estimate at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIJdypOqlL4&amp;t=3m49s">3:49</a>.<br />Can anyone explain how could this become under 1$ PER YEAR ?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIJdypOqlL4&amp;t=4m10s">4:10</a> Doesn&#39;t it say $4.69 monthly estimate?
Are you kidding me? You are talking a foreign language for normal people. Im out.
Very informative, thank you.
I want to start by thanking you because everything worked—you explained everything very clearly. Personally, I felt like I was able to keep up but your speed sure did keep me on my toes. I had to rewind about a thousand times so it took me nearly 3 hours to get it all done.
You attack hosting companies for charging a fee for genuine reasons (cPanel, upkeep etc...), then go on to show people exactly how to not set-up a website. Opening a terminal, installing a lamp, and saying that is enough is painful to watch, especially as it expects that everyone who is watching has a degree in bash. You ran everything using root, no mention of csf or any form or protection, who cares about xml-rpc attack prevention, ssl or updating plugins heh? If anyone is watching this in 2020, please don&#39;t listen to this video, the author doesn&#39;t even have the confidence to keep the domain active.
I am stuck once Chris says to copy and paste in terminal. this is what I have when I copy the gcloud command line, &quot;gcloud beta compute ssh --zone &quot;us-west1-b&quot; &quot;wordpress3&quot; --project &quot;crucial-bloom-292621&quot;
 <br />Has anybody else had trouble at this point or can help me? Thanks
ERROR: (gcloud.projects.create) Operation [cp.7285821645323135623] failed: 9: Callers must accept Terms of Service
isnt free
@Psycho Bastard Thank-you. I&#39;ve been looking into it but haven&#39;t done it, because that price tag at the bottom scares me; I understand I can tweak specs after. Do you know a good freehosting service that lets you use an SSL cert. ? I&#39;m even prepared to parse my site to html files.
Thank-you. I was looking for ~free hosting with ssl.<br />This also means I can start unlearning PHP.
I&#39;m guessing from your command prompt that the answer is yes.
Can you create a WordPress site there?
If this works, it&#39;s cheaper than AWS!
OK, if I type the IP in the browser bar I get the Apache2 Ubuntu Default page &quot;It works.&quot; What did I do wrong so the name is not working?
I was all excited and everything working well until got to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIJdypOqlL4&amp;t=15m36s">15:36</a> and I got unable to reach this site. I can ping the IP successfully, but no connection. I checked network traffic on Chrome developer tools but not much help - any suggestions?
WOWOWOW
WOWOWOW
There are no free lunch man.
What does $4.68 monthly means???
Forget Google Cloud.. how did you get that fancy CPU monitor and clock on your desktop... 😲😲😲😲
It took me more than I expected but worked just fine. Thank you so much for this video!
I&#39;ve just set this up with an ubuntu 20.04 minimal instance. FYI it looks like this version doesn&#39;t come with a &quot;dialog-like program&quot; installed, meaning it all goes wrong at the point of installing the lamp server. &lt;Sudo apt install whiptail&gt; will fix it.
You cant do this from a windows PC?
What about bandwidth? Have limt
I managed to set up a VM with these instructions and it has been working flawlessly for over a month now, however I need FTP access to it so wordpress can install plugins. How do I get that part sorted?
Quite straightforward really !<br />it would be better if you wait a couple of seconds before pressing enter - it often scrolls out of sight the command and stopping the video at the exact split second may be a challenge; turning your video to a computer game for testing reflexes - [not my favourite game] :)
I guess this video is definitely not for windows users nor it is for Linux-illiterate sub-species of Humans.
Hommage to you Titus Magnus; Emperor of the green bytes.
I lost every shred of respect i had for you when you used wordpress. Disgusting. Never watching another video from you
I got stuck on &quot;GRANT ALL ON wordpress.* TO &#39;wordpressuser&#39; IDENTIFIED BY &#39;Secure1234!&#39;;&quot;. mySQL came back with an error in syntax. Couldn&#39;t ever resolve it so I came to the comments here to see if anyone else had the problem but I see that it looks like Chris hasn&#39;t ever responded to any of the questions here. Too bad...I almost learned something. As my dad had told me many times when I was a child...son, there&#39;s nothing free in life, everything has a cost. But the service is free, at least initially and for the first several hundred hours as of this writing. After that they will start billing from what I can tell. All said it was an interesting exercise and I learned a few things so for that I&#39;m grateful.
thank you, sir! after a year i have been charged - 6 eur.;-) not what i expected from &quot;free hosting&quot;
as long as you use this regions:<br /><br />us-west1-a<br />or<br />us-west1-b<br />or<br />us-west1-c<br /><br />..with &quot;micro 1&quot;...<br /><br />...you don&#39;t have to worry about losing your penny... it&#39;s completely free...
Can we do it on windows??bcz I&#39;m noob
my internet crashed just before installing wordpress, with xvf command, how i log by terminal to gcloud again to continue ?
@Error establishing a database connection@ when going to the external ip because my DNS provider wont work either
this video is impossible to follow , so many adverts due to too many timestamps , clicked skip ad more than 20 times before finishing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIJdypOqlL4&amp;t=8m26s">8:26</a> crazy. The insane advertising revenue has made YT unusable for things like this. Gave up in the end.
You either pay for the product or you are the product.
Remember this is just hosting. NOT domain registration. So don&#39;t expect to tell your friends to open your website or something!!
Can you show a simular exsample whan setting up Nextcloud on Ubuntu 20LTS?
Damn, your website loads super fast, I wish to be so techy as you are with server management via command line
awesome vid , nice sandbox if nothing else , and the price is right 9= )
hello very good video and how do you explain it thank you very much
 <br />a question does not have a video of how to do it from windows thank you very much happy monday ❤
It’s come a long way, great vid- <br />Simple simple
Do you know how to transfer an already existing hosting from yahoo small business to g cloud
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIJdypOqlL4&amp;t=2m02s">2:02</a> no they use their own servers as its against google clouds terms. It also costs a lot of money for cPanel and you need CentOS or CloudLinuxOS for cPanel (google doesn&#39;t offer those os&#39;s)
This is just for installing wordpress ry? For everything else u can do quite easily with GitHub free hosting and netlify🤷
Love it. Great stuff Chris !
WHat about security?
Good for WordPress?
You must have been grandfathered in to the service. Now they only offer free trial, after which they will charge.
Does anyone know if does the free tier still exist ?
This video is a absolute waste of time...
Goodbye to privacy
but how get ssl certificate?
Very nice. Good thing I watched it on a Saturday.
Is this process still for free?
My goodness ChrisT. I never thought that this would be that easy. Been dealing w/ shared host companies w/ poor servcies for year. But this i have total control. Open a new world for me and it wont be for word press. Great job on vids. Fun, Good Pace, and added humor. Thanks a bunch and happily subscribed and will be following.
I would guess things changed since then, but trying to see what you can do nowadays besides the &quot;free trial&quot;
What trick makes the hosting free? It is not clear if I do not install all that useless for me soft can I get free hosting or not?
The &quot;green code screen&quot; is his terminal window on his computer. Yours may be a different color just look for the application called terminal on your Linux computer.<br /><br />Copy the code like Chris did just before the 5-minute mark and paste that into your terminal window.
When he says paste this into terminal at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIJdypOqlL4&amp;t=5m00s">5:00</a> then just pull up a green code screen that he did not show us how to get too. 90% of viewers who are noobs are now lost.
Can you make a shell script to do it?<br />\
Excellent video! Loved it
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIJdypOqlL4&amp;t=4m14s">4:14</a> it says that this VM will cost approx $4 per month..how are you circumventing that?
Does this platform allows you to run a Windows 2020 like a laptop on cloud for free? Something along the line of amazon ec2.
Need credit card . Real free website is github lol
great video, however after everything is set up, I tried installing a Wordpress theme and it prompted an ftp login stuff. had no clue what to put in the Hostname, FTP Username and FTP Password
good video
still applicable?
Ummmmm 🤯
F off racist
your shitty whiteface is anooying
I&#39;m not getting how did count the costs? It shows for you 4,68 dollars/per month and yet you claim to pay a dollar per year. If I choose datacenter in Europe, in Germany, it shows me costs over 8,84 dollars, but interestingly, when I switch to Zurich, cost estimates are gone. It also shows 0,012 $ per hour. How is the real cost calculated thou? Only when a user enters the site and is browsing it? Or maybe per session time on backend, or both? Or maybe per OS running time? So should I power it down when not needed?<br />Thanks for the explanation.
Not true. If anyone from China Asia region tries to probe your site, you will see your bill soon reach crazily heigh, and it’s just wasted money
Me da risa cuando hablan de otras plataformas que te prometen ser ninjas en 5 minutos y ya se de cuál hablan, jeje. Muy buen equipo EDTeam, explican muy bien. Saludos!
If i use CodeIgniter, how to use in google cloud ?
Exactly. They&#39;ll steal more of your data.
@Jaïr van der Sterre ngl, I prefer to pay less money and more data at this point. I&#39;m cheap and everything you want to know about me is already online because family. So like, yeah, chose your poison, money or data
Does this still work
&quot;Are you sick of paying? How would you like to pay?&quot; Lol.
same here
Hey man, thanks for the video! I just set up my website and am trying to add different WordPress themes. It is asking for a host, ftp username and password. Where do I find this info/how do i set these up. Thanks in advance!
Hi Chris , i was getting away from Linux after years ,but i will be back to it if you help me using Ngnix instead of apache,in your exemple .is it easy? like switching Nginx to Apache somewhere in &quot;config.php &quot;, i m not sure .Thank you.
Killer write up! Thank you so much for putting this together. The apache2buddy saved me at the end. My dog get out of our yard right as I was saving this and I somehow managed to copy the whole mpm ifmodule section in the 1st line. apache2buddy showed me the syntax error and your great instructions allowed me to easily jump back in and find the issue. Many thanks for sure! definitely subscribing.
Hey Chris, you know you can stop apache while you are setting things up =&gt; <b>systemctl apache2 stop</b>
What on eart did you do at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIJdypOqlL4&amp;t=13m54s">13:54</a>?
Pppp
God Job chris. thank you soooo much!!!
chris I have a question is it possible to connect to mysql remotely. from my local machine using the ip provided by the gcloud vm?
Please it&#39;s always start as free but after it&#39;s turn out to paying lool
You&#39;re like literally looking at the cloud while you&#39;re talking.
lol micro avg 5$ / month and you can run your website on a 10 year old laptop
Can you host adult material?
Do you not need to register the domain name separately?
Unfortunately over my head
Is not free if you pay for it
I hate how title says free and you still need to pay for it as others are talking about ,a good way to loose customers trust and gain views for your self income
This is the part that I missed in the 80s, never thought thinking out of the box would go that way. You are amazing :)
Any experience with a LEMP stack on GCP?
You are for linux what Linus is for PC hardware!
Nothing is for free. You pay with Google in other ways.
Free hosting until Google decides it does not like what you are saying on your website and suspends you for &quot;violating terms of service&quot;.
adding &quot;linux&quot;&quot; to the title would be helpful.
Must the card be credit card? I dont feel like renewing mine, cant it be debit?
Even if the VM is free, aren&#39;t you billed for the network egress ?<br /><br />Making a site is great, but once it becomes popular, or is attacked by bots, won&#39;t the cost increase?
Fantastic! Thank you so much.
So this is like paying but with super unneeded extra steps that are not worth it to 99% of people. Thanks but rather go to a managed services for about same price. Its just a 3 month free trial so what&#39;s the point. Doing all this labour in case it actually works.
Digital ocean has better pricing
this is now outdated the pricing is nolonger available
Why free?
Will this work in China? Because China has blocked all google services
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIJdypOqlL4&amp;t=17m10s">17:10</a> You can not use the IDENTIFIED BY in GRANT statement. first you have to create the user in MySQL with &quot;CREATE USER &#39;wordpressuser&#39; IDENTIFIED BY &#39;Secure1234!&#39; &quot;.😉
The comment I was looking for
Glad to hear it - thanks for the feedback!
Wow this is the 3rd maybe 4th time today that this page has helped me out. Thank you for knowing what questions people need help with!
I used this method almost 8 months ago and have yet to pay a single penny.
&quot;Your first 744 hours is free on this month&quot;<br />You can use your vm only for 31 days per month<br />But you mays how you can use more hours per month?<br />Actually you can have more than 1 vm for free, so this is a way to do this.<br />I mean it&#39;s just a theory actually....
&quot;Your first 744 hours is free on this month&quot;<br /><br />free for 31 days, on this month
I missed the part where you pay less than a dollar a year. The instance you started is $4.68/month or $56.16 a year. Where is the free part?
is this free forever or just for a certain time limit?
why should hosting companies cry over this? Free hosting you say, but why does it say monthly cost estimate? 26 Us
Reported! There&#39;s no such thing as free host FYI
one word.. Netlify
Happy new year Chris. This is another great delivery. I love your style, knowledge and presentation.
you forgot to mention that f1 micro instances only free if it&#39;s on iowa, oregon, or south carolina
Nope
can you get the domain name for free?<br />i didn&#39;t understand that part🤔
Sure if you want your site monitored, datamined and possibly censored by Big G.
Great<br />Your face remind me to linus torvalds!
It is now under series N1 then go to machine type.
You&#39;re welcome!
@Tony Teaches Tech I have encountered a small problem and am not sure whether this is due to Wordpress or Google Cloud. I can not create any new post or page. I get the message saying &quot;you are offline&quot; when I click Publish in Wordpress. Any ideas?
@Ayn Ml Hmm, I have not seen this one yet. Can you tell if the error message is coming from WordPress or the Nginx server?
@Tony Teaches Tech actually I was able to find out after a bit of googling. It seems Wordpress settings were HTTP which needed to be changes to HTTPS. That fixed the issue
You are a ROCKSTAR! THANK YOU!
Unfortunately that&#39;s not possible
@Tony Teaches Tech actually found it later. Thanks Tony!
I forgot my username and password. is there a way I can reset this?
this is BS
1 dollar is not free !!!! im looking for free webhost becoz i cant pay a penny !!! my shitty country doesnt allow us to transfer money outside the country !!!!
You&#39;re very welcome!
Thank you for making a well laid out tutorial.
There are so few updated versions available that work. It all went well until the SQL.
Where is the link for gcloud
so is it working?
&#39;And just paste that into terminal&#39; - maybe just for me, but a big step that was not intuitive. I CMD+F terminal pasted and no luck.
someone else here who is missing the option to use the mysql commons?
Is GCloud now google cloud sdk?
I&#39;m seeing the same thing, did you end up completing this? Any luck keeping costs down?
@Colter Joles No I haven&#39;t. Plus it required me to have a debit card which I don&#39;t have.
Is this still possible today? I&#39;m being offered a $300 credit for the next 90 days and from what I saw, their cheapest plan is around $35 to $50. I&#39;m an aspiring Freelancer and just wanted a simple WordPress website for myself as a Virtual Assistant/Freelancer.
This is an excellent video. Very helpful. Thank you!
GRANT ALL ON wordpress.* TO &#39;wordpressuser&#39; IDENTIFIED BY &#39;Secure1234!&#39;; is deprecated? I had to CREATE USER first and GRANT ALL (without IDENTIFIED BY) later
shout out thank you for this I still have a lot of things need to know what is sudo and some code i still didn&#39;t understand this
Thank you :)
For those of you who are confused as to where the micro instance is:<br />Under Machine configuration &gt; Series<br />Select N1<br /><br />Under Machine configuration &gt; Machine type<br />Select f1-micro
Can I use the same method on my Mac or windows PC?
Working on FiveM too??
great
What type of desktop is that?
So, Chris, does this Google Cloud will handle any (small) mail server next to web server? That would be awsome.
I&#39;m still not going to host my site on anything google touches. I wouldn&#39;t touch youtube if it weren&#39;t for the fact that it isn&#39;t the content makers fault
There&#39;s no built-in control panel
is there a control panel to reach the /var/www for if you want to create another website instead of wordpress
how to reach the control panel like plex as on a paid web host ?
Does this still work
when connecting to the site, putty puts up and i dont know what to do, help
Its too technical for a non technical person. Can you please define it in detail what does these green lines mean or suggest me blog or something that can help me in learning it
You said, that you upgraded your VM. How many requests/users do you have?
where is that lovely cheat-sheet of yours? the link doesnt work anymore.
The description link sends me to a &quot;debloating Windows 10&quot; guide instead....

Nice video and I am a baby noob. My question is this: can I upload my own html files to this?
@Corey F yes you can
Do you know i <a href="http://asp.net/">asp.net</a> core would run on that microservice? I normally run <a href="http://asp.net/">asp.net</a> core on a vps with a cpu and ubuntu, is that the same as on a microservice, what do you pay if your website is used a lot by a lot of users.
hosting okay but can we make email accounts also ?
@Chris 
 <br />Do we need to setup Network Service Tier? Premium or Standard? in order to get Always free tier.
Yves Tan search the Marketplace for &quot;LAMP certified by Bitnami&quot;, they include SSL auto-configuration.<br />Alternatively maybe try to set it up with Cloudflare.
Please do an update, almost none of this works for me now
@Muhammad Bilal Memon obviously, you&#39;ve got to know how to use Linux before you can do this stuff. If not, go learn that first. Or pay money to the people who knows how to do it for you. :)
hey can you do this in windows 10 or do we need to be running linux, can you tell us the commands for windows instead?
how you set up google cloud account I have but you mention a free tier do I sign up or what ?
 <br />
 <br />what about subdomains as websites ?
  can i create subdomains ? <br />
 <br />your curl command is not in your notes
  <br />
 <br />after mysql the password secure is not in notes
 <br />

You Should use Infinityfree
Hello, I have developed a website using Python 3.6 and Django 2.14. I have also purchased a domain name from Google. Will I be able to host my website using GCP.
Hello, I have developed a website using Python 3.6 and Django 2.14. I have also purchased a domain name from Google. Will I be able to host my website using GCP.
  Do you have any idea.
Gcp is cheaper than now 😅 ,,, now minimum payment is $5
@Alexander The Tech Guy They&#39;re no good at all. They just kicked me out for a lame excuse.
@Sudipta Basu Yes you can. Just register at GCP and you will get $300 credits and three month free trial.
@Alexander The Tech Guy Infinity Free is no good at all! They kick me out because they said my website was DDoS attacked. But I really much doubt the reason because of two things.<br /><br />I just had one time to use the CPU utilization almost 50 percent during backup and I don&#39;t know why it took quite a lot of CPU utilization, and they sent me a warning email. Not long after that they suspended my account because of the alleged DDoS attack. The funny thing is they also sent another email a few hours later to ask me to subscribe to their paid hosting.<br />And the weirdest thing, is they informed me a few weeks after my account was suspended that I over utilized the CPU. How is it possible since I had already not used their hosting after my account was revoked and I couldn&#39;t use it if I wanted it to.
@Rahmat Hidayah I was charged the equivalent of almost $2 last December 2020.
Glad it was helpful!

A tip: you can watch movies at flixzone. Me and my gf have been using it for watching a lot of movies during the lockdown.
@Finnley Angel yup, been watching on Flixzone for since november myself :)
Hi! Very good materials provided by you, most of them are common sense. The logic used is applied by different companies, so you do not need to be Google to have this kind of interviews. On the other hand, very dissapointed by Google Interview process. No HR involved in the interview, sales consultants are performing it and they just write what you have said but not word by word. In addition the line is dropping so the connection is bad from their side, hence all the efforts are useless. Honestly I had a lot of interviews but never been so dissapointed by the one from Google
yes, I am preparing my interview tomorrow, hope I will be win that.
Hey Jeff I have an interview for Technical Account Manager, Google Cloud Professional Services, i would really appreciate if you could help with more information on what to expect from the interviewers.
how was the coding interview? Focus on scripting or algorithms?
Good luck!!
How did it go? Anything you can share with me to prepare for mine?
Great video, I have my final GCP customer engineer interview on Monday! So excited. Your videos have been a big help.
Valerie, Let me tackle these questions for you, 1. GCP is trying to be number two in cloud in the next five years and it is going to take a tremendous push to get there, also given the current landscape, growing this part of the business is critical. 2. Assuming EBP is Executive Business Partner, those roles require the same level of preparation as any other role with a focus on proactivity and prioritization. 3. I did a whole series of videos on salary negotiations. The number one item is ideally you do not want to show your cards, make them make the first offer - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcNUkCG-MWM&amp;list=PLePbzYpjlB26R3txWFeG8pjRy9Nb0gYWd">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcNUkCG-MWM&amp;list=PLePbzYpjlB26R3txWFeG8pjRy9Nb0gYWd</a>
Jeff H Sipe , thank you very much! Will watch these series. Yes, exactly , Executive Business Partner. Educating myself via your videos over a week now. Made a huge progress for myself. Can’t thank you enough for this content!
Hi! Thank you very much for the inside , you are doing great job for all of us. Why GCP hiring so much people now, what is the reason ? What you will advice for EBP roles? And negotiations about salary part? It is really hard to find the average info about that
@Larry Hoover Sorry to hear that! I have mine next week. Any tips you can share would be great?
@Atul Sawant How did yours go? Can you share your experience on the role and associated RRK interview? Tnx..
Larry, yes, very normal, going to HC is amazing! Good luck, let us all know the result if you are willing!
@Jeff H Sipe Does everyone get sent to HC? I will definitely let you know the results either way. Your videos and insights were invaluable in any result! How many folks that get sent to HC actually get an offer?
@Larry Hoover Only a small percentage of people make it to HC. The percentages really vary role to role, some people make it through, some do not, and others will get feedback from HC that they need more data and that requires at least one additional interview. So yes, now you are in the waiting game, good luck!
@Jeff H Sipe still waiting for feedback from the HC, the recruiter did say it would be the end of this week, was supposed to be the end of last week. Still alive!
@Larry Hoover keep us updated! Sometimes HC&#39;s fill up with too many candidates so you get pushed to the following week.
@Jeff H Sipe Well earlier this week, I was told it would be by end this week and here we are with no update...positive vibes decreasing...
@Larry Hoover Check in with your Recruiter right now if you have not already!
@Jeff H Sipe I have my feedback call later today, like at the end of the day, and is only a phone call not a video call...I am assuming its a rejection.
@Jeff H Sipe Hiring Committee rejected me! damn it!
@Larry Hoover So, I am hoping that you can reflect positivity on what happened. VERY FEW people ever make it to this stage and anyone that makes it this far will definitely be revisited by Google in the future. And your Recruiter should have already had this positive tone with you, you will have other chances. I sincerely appreciate you sharing your journey with the audience, I know it is personal and hard to share right now, but I know you will have another chance. Good luck!
@Jeff H Sipe I can only give half the credit to you! I will recommend your channel to everyone! She said we can revisit in 5 months if I am still on the market!
@Larry Hoover You deserve all the credit for putting in the hard work. Keep at it and keep us all updated. Thank you!
Atul Sawant having those frameworks is most important but understanding their question and using the frameworks is easily as important.
@Larry Hoover Yes Larry, very true!!
What is the typical process? So I had my phone screen, then was shifted so another recruiter. I was told would have all 3 interviews (RRK, GCA, Leadership/Googlyness) in one day. That was back tracked and had my RRK alone. Passed that and moved onto another round the following week (RCA, I Leadership/Googlyness). I was told would get feedback from that and see what the potential next steps are. Then the recruiter said all the information is being sent to the hiring committee for review and once they hear back from the hiring committee, they will reach out to me and set up a time to discuss. Is that the normal process?
hp1day, awesome! I am so glad my videos helped you!
I want to thank Jeff&#39;s tireless work. It has helped me tremendously with my Google interview.
sw, infrastructure is obviously at the heart of GCP. So practicing for this type of interview, I want you to go more in depth on understanding and being able to connect the history of Google to current times,. Focus on the strong benefits of IAAS and just understand how GCP&#39;s multiple offerings all tie back to it&#39;s awesome infra. I hope this helps!
Hey @Jeff H Sipe...Thanks for this useful content, Appreciate your efforts. What would you suggest for preparing for a cloud infrastructure interview position?
Erik, the ABP (Administrative Business Partner) positions on the cloud teams should not differ from other teams. These roles are all about your ability to listen, collaborate, prioritize, stay organized, streamline processes, and anticipate needs! I hope this helps!
Hey Jeff! Is there anything you can share about the ABP positions on the cloud teams? Are those teams more social, more technical, more anything else? My recruiter contacted me about an opportunity and looking for as much insight as possible. I love working with fun groups! Thanks
Abrar, I want you to really understand what are the core components of what would make for a solid Field Marketing Rep first, then focus on the specific offerings of Google Cloud. Build the foundation and then focus on adding specificity. I hope this helps!
Hi Jeff, Thank you for taking the effort to make these videos, they’ve been very useful! I have my first GCA interview in a couple of days for a Google Cloud Field Marketing role. Would you have any specific tips for marketing roles?
Gloria, the TAM role is a great position. You need to bring both strong collaborative/people skills &amp; technical skills to the interview, they will look for both! Spend time learning about GCP if you do not already have that foundation knowledge. Good luck!
Jeff H Sipe thank you I will do so. I was already taking the GCP foundation course at Coursera
Hi thanks for the video. I have a telephone interview for Technical Accounts Manager (Professional Services) any advice on how to prep for it.
Suchitra, good question, typically the Architect is not pre-sales, but could obviously support teams in this facet. Typically, this is when a company has either agreed to work with Google or has an established relationship with GCP.
Do you have tips for the newly created role of Enterprise Cloud Architect? it is in the pre-sales world
Indrajit, amazing!!! Congrats!!!
I cracked my google interview largely owing to your videos. Thank you so much Jeff!
Sanjeev, it really depends on the role, a DevOps Engineer would likely get some of these types of questions. Remember, it is totally okay to ask your Recruiter exactly what to expect in the interview including the subject matter that will be covered. But it will vary greatly depending on your DevOps focus. I hope this helps!
Hi Jeff, Thanks for sharing the important points. I, however, want to know if I go for the DevOps role in Google, would I be asked any question on Algorithm and Data Structure, Time and Space Complexity, mathematical Modelling(If i have a coding background). Or it just asks questions specific to DevOps and cloud
Khushil, this first interview will be a mix of communication skills and technical skills. Given your YOE, really slow down when you get the questions, be thoughtful and take your time. Don&#39;t forget on the open-ended side to really clarify what is being asked of you. I know this is pretty high level, but I hope it helps! Good luck!!
Hi Jeff, your videos really help. I have my telephonic interview for developer programs engineer-cloud in few days and my recruiter told me it is going to be 60 min call mix of behavior-technical questions and coding. Any tip from you would be highly appreciated <br /><br />I am just starting out my YOE 1.5
Sindhu, thank you, I live this hoody, so comfortable!!
Thank you for the reply
Love the hoody.. thank you for all the hard work
@Jeff H Sipe Thanks again. That certainly clears up some of the uncertainty. Will certainly double check with the recruiter from the outset.
@Jeff H Sipe thanks for video Jeff. Any tips for a university graduate Technical Solutions Engineer interview?
@Jeff H Sipe thank you
Adam, great question. It depends! If you are interviewing for a more straight up Cloud Engineer role, yes, if you are interviewing for a more Customer Engineer role, no. My best advice is always ask the Recruiter early on in the process it will require coding. I hope this helps!
@Mariam Leigh, really focus on technical fundamentals. TSE&#39;s can be asked a lot of different technical questions, so be ready for anything! The good news is that these interviews are best suited for someone coming out of school. Good luck!
Hey Jeff. this was a really top video and really helped. Many Thanks. As part of the interview will Google do a coding section, possibly with Python, for the Cloud engineer role?
sure
Please make one video about Office365 administrator .share point
Thanks!

Great Video, THank you soo much
This is a great video, step by step demo of the process. I tried doing the same, Couldn&#39;t find the Wordpress by Bitnami rather Word press by Bitnami &amp; Automatic. Now it does not allow me to log into the WP admin even in the first instance. Deleted the first deployment &amp; redeployed. Same error. Any guidance?
Hello Utechpia, seriously very good and informative video it is. i have just made my website hosted on GCP with the help of your video. <br><br>i need a little help more if you can make a complete video on &quot;multisite wordpress certified by bitnami and automattic&quot; from scratch to making subdomains on the website.<br>it will really help us to making subdomains on our website.<br>best regards

Cpanel is not free, you have to pay a subscription to use Cpanel. Also, the CPU that we use for the FREE GCP hosting isn&#39;t powerful enough to host Cpanel + Wordpress. If you need Cpanel, this is not a solution for you. Hope that helps! BTW: If you haven&#39;t already done so, please consider subscribing to UTECHPIA, I&#39;m trying very hard to grow this channel for the last 3 years. Thanks :)
you didn&#39;t provide how to setup CPanel if you would have it could have much more

This is the best tutorial I&#39;ve seen. It&#39;s my first UTECHPIA video. Thank you!
Yeah, but the 90 days is enough to test out your traffic, we focus on using the &quot;Always Free Tier&quot; anyway.. and that is still &quot;Always Free&quot;. Thanks for the support, my friend! Cheers! :)

GCP is free only for 90days now.. they screwed up... but see what happens.. great stuff regardless
You can, but keep in mind that those features are expensive. You&#39;ll have to do your own cost analysis. The purpose of my video is to really take advantage of the basic features offered by the Always-Free Tier and get the MOST of GCP while not paying more than a few cents per month. Let me know if that answers your question. Thanks!
UTECHPIA it did. Thank you
Do you dabble in virtual currencies??
What if I wanna use their vps?
Hi Johnny B, thanks for watching my video and thanks for your feedback. I did a TERRIBLE job at explaining this part. The estimate price on the Bitnami setup screen doesn&#39;t take into consideration that we&#39;re going to be taking advantage of Google&#39;s Free Tier. Since we are using a f1-micro CPU on (us-west1, us-central1, or us-east1), then the CPU is free. Here&#39;s more details of the free tier: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier">https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier</a> . Let me know if you have any other feedback or questions. Thanks Again!

Thanks so much for checking out the video, Chris! Thanks for your kind words! Have a great day, my friend!
AWESOME VIDEO! Thanks for sharing!
Try this updated command instead: sudo /opt/bitnami/bncert-tool
@UTECHPIA Thanks for the response man, but still not working :(<br><br>sudo: /opt/bitnami/bncert-tool: command not found<br><br>BTW, i guess my vm instance doesn&#39;t have bitnami.
@Roj Sedqi , did you make sure to deploy the &quot;Wordpress Certified by Bitnami and Automatic&quot;? Or did you deploy a different package?
Hi there!<br>I get this error&quot;<br><br>sudo: /opt/bitnami/letsencrypt/scripts/<a href="http://generate-certificate.sh/">generate-certificate.sh</a>: command not found
@UTECHPIA I am having the same problem though I am copying the same temporary password.
@Rafael Mejia Hey I guess it&#39;s because of localhost issue, you need to change the SSH settings in order to log in as an admin in your system. I haven&#39;t tried but follow this video and try once, if it&#39;s working do let me know as well.
@UTECHPIA if you can help resolve this issue, it would be really nice
@Rafael Mejia I even tried with other browser, but still redirects to login page. Can&#39;t find a solution, don&#39;t know how it&#39;s happening.
@Rafael Mejia let me try clearing the cache and cookies
Same problem here, I am able to see the website running but it is not possible to login as admin, I will appreciate any help. Thanks for the amazing video ​ @UTECHPIA
@Dev_Invincible Jeet this is not saying that the password is wrong, but it is not redirecting to the WP Dashboard. very weird...
@UTECHPIA I found the solution for myself. I just by clearing browser cookies and Cache.
@Dev_Invincible Jeet Try incognito in Chrome
You might have copied the password and username wrong. Check GCP &gt; Deployment Manager, and verify the username and login password.
WordPress account created successfully however I can not log in as an admin using the provided password ??
I don&#39;t recommend doing that the f1-micro VM is not very strong. If you want to create a second website, create a new gmail account and create another GCP account :)
@UTECHPIA I thank you very much for your kind reply but I&#39;m bit surprised cause I already installed not one but 4 website acually (Im going creating the dns zone today for the last one) and the VM is actually using f1-micro with a swapfile only 1GB on 20GB disk and everything is working well. May be a bit slow at moment but this is a test , my understing of the cloud is I can use upgrade to better hw the same VM cause I have no intention to create one vm for one website, at least I understood I can do everything on one VM and upgrade id the performance are not good. I was using in this test openlitespeed wordpress but I was in confusion for the virtual host, thats why I asked you , I thought I could use binamy in case I could not fix my issue, in any case I fixed this morning after having watched your video making new test so thanks again for your kind reply, at present I will go on on my deployment, cheers !
Hi boss ! can you pls explain how to install 2 website in the same vm (virtual host) ? thanks in advance !

@UTECHPIA How to delete the old certificate? It is not letting me do anything as long as the old still exists. Please help
Please help in my above question when you can
Sounds like &quot;Blocks&quot; in a Blockchain.
Try this new command on your VM via SSH: This SSL certificate will AUTOMATICALLY renew, and it’s 100% FREE!<br><br>sudo /opt/bitnami/bncert-tool
I&#39;m trying to do this, but how do I get my SSL Certificate on the Domain, or buy a new one?
Hello, my friend! Glad you like the video. Did you get any error when trying to login? Check the username/password from the Deployment Manager.
@UTECHPIA Yes, double checked the ID and Password. Now using, WordPress Multisite by Bitnami. It worked.
Thank a lot for posting this video. Log in is not happening with wordpress. It shows the same page again.<br>Tried clearing and enabling cookies but to no avail. Can you help ?

@UTECHPIA Oh man, I&#39;m very grateful with you. I finished my Wordpress Site and now I know a little of what is the gcp free tier, I did the same steps as you described (everything very clear and explained in the video), now I&#39;m searching for the best cloudfare settings for my site because I don&#39;t get higher than PageSpeed 84% and Yslow 82%, I didn&#39;t put my cache 1 month because I&#39;ll be making a lot of changes, it will be an online shopping site with WooCommerce.<br><br>Thank you for your answer and to be the best helping a noobie, I appreciate your efforts!
Hi UTECHPIA! I have a question:<br>How is this all free and the Wordpress by Bitnami deployment says it costs $13.61 monthly. I will be charged after my trial credit gets consumed and now it will be $13.61 + the cents you said? Sorry, I&#39;m a little bit confused and also sorry for my english hehe.<br><br>Btw, great video !
In your case, the DNS would be CloudFlare. I recommend contacting SendGrid and asking them how to properly configure the MX Records for CloudFlare. Good luck, my friend.
@UTECHPIA you are right. I&#39;m in a free tier account on sendgrid too so I hope they answer me hahahaha<br>About the MX records, that seems like something I need because I don&#39;t have MX records on my CloudFlare and also sendgrid isn&#39;t telling me to add MX records but I read that the MX records are used for mailing 🤔<br><br>Thank you friend! I followed you on every social media like a good stalker hahaha
Good luck my friend! Thanks for the support! You ROCK! 😁👍
Hi man! Thank you for you help, I&#39;m finishing my setup but I have a problem, What if I want a third party email service like SendGrid? I&#39;m a little bit confused with the DNS records, it says I need a Sender Authentication so I have to Authenticate my Domain but I&#39;m stucked adding those records, I&#39;m confused which is my DNS host (GoDaddy,CloudFlare,GCP), I tried adding those DNS records type CNAME on CloudFlare but didn&#39;t worked at verifying.

Hi. Thank you for this the clear explanation, very detailed you make it look easy (and it isn&#39;t). One thing I don&#39;t get it&#39;s how muchs does it cost after all? Because as it can be seen in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG9kv5-5bPI&amp;t=05m15s">05:15</a> when you selected the options, the summary says &quot;6.35 per month&quot;. It&#39;s that correct?

Hi Buddy! Try to reconfigure your SSL certificate using the updated feature: This SSL certificate will AUTOMATICALLY renew, and it’s 100% FREE! Here&#39;s the command to execute it (after you SSH into your VM): sudo /opt/bitnami/bncert-tool
Hello UTECHPIA! When I click on &quot;LOGIN TO ADMIN PANEL&quot;, It says :<br><br> Redirect Notice<br> The page you were on is trying to send you to http://34.82.190.167//wp-admin/.<br> If you do not want to visit that page, you can return to the previous page.<br><br> Please help! I am stuck here... The username and password doesn&#39;t work. <br> Please reply at the earliest, Thanks in advance.
Yep, lots of people use wordpress! :)
People still use Wordpress?
Get the password and username from GCP &gt; Deployment Manager. Good luck, my friend!
@UTECHPIA Thanks@ I m all set but facing other difficulties. I&#39;m using google as my domain and followed the same exact as u said. But the DNS is blocking my incoming mails. what should i do?
Hi.. I m in step 2 right now. I am trying to login using the user id and password, but I can&#39;t get in.. what should I do?
Try this new method to generated the SSL certificate: sudo /opt/bitnami/bncert-tool
Hi! I managed to get things going up until the SSL Certificate.

Sorry fo the long comment but any help is welcome.
I forgot the wp-admin password and there is no easy way to reset it because SMTP is not configured. I tried enable SMTP with MailGun but am stuck at some error. So, I suggest to add configuring SMTP as part of this video (or the next one in a series or a playlist) as it is the most essential service for a wordpress instance.

thank you!
Hi Huy, yes, you can. But, please keep in mind that once your website grows and you have lots of traffic you will have to upgrade from the free tier. The key to making it work as a ecommerce website is simply finding the right WordPress theme that has ecommerce features. Good luck, my friend!
@UTECHPIA which web hosting is the cheapest and most reliable once I upgrade? Is WordPress theme availability the same through different web hosting or they aren&#39;t? Thank you for the wonderful tutorial..
@Huy Tran GCP is extremely reliable and extremely fast, but it is NOT cheap. The idea is that once you are getting enough traffic to need to update, you&#39;ll be making enough money to afford one of the best webhost out there, GCP. Yeah, the wordpress theme you would need for ecommerce would be the same as if you were to host on any standard webhost.
@UTECHPIA thank you ! i subscribed to your channel!
can you use this to open an ecommerce website?
Yep, 100%, a basic website, it is fast enough. It&#39;s not that slow. My website <a href="http://www.kidphotofun.com/">www.KidPhotoFun.com</a> is fast, running on the F1-micro CPU.
Try to improve performance with CloudFlare and with caching. Also, try to use optimize the size of your image files.
@UTECHPIA do you have a tutorial demonstrating it?
@bhavin v , Sorry, I don&#39;t. but search google for &quot;how to make my wordpress faster&quot; and you will find ways to optimize your website. BTW: your backend (in wordpress admin) might be a little slow, but when you are viewing the website as a guest, it will be much faster.
I tried this and my website is very slow. It&#39;s a basic website not heavy like ecommerce. Is that normal? <br>I have installed astra theme and no extra plugins other than elementor.<br>How can I make it faster?
Thank you so much, very useful video.
Update for Step#6: mentioned command doesn&#39;t works, this command worked for me sudo /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/bnconfig.disabled --disable_banner 1 and then the mentioned command to restart apache, enjoy
my whole life changed because of, <b>e z g o o d p a y .c o m</b>
Hi Dave! The old way of setting up the SSL (like in this tutorial) doesn&#39;t work with cloud flare. I recommend using the new method, using this command: sudo /opt/bitnami/bncert-tool <br>Here&#39;s some more information on it: <a href="https://docs.bitnami.com/google/how-to/generate-install-lets-encrypt-ssl/">https://docs.bitnami.com/google/how-to/generate-install-lets-encrypt-ssl/</a>
@UTECHPIA Thank you for the response. It worked like a charm!
Amazing tutorial..<br><br>I just have a query. I created my blog 3-4 months ago and now the let&#39;s encrypt certificate has expired.<br>I am unable to renew it. Tried to search a lot on the internet but no luck.<br>Can you please tell how to renew it?<br><br>Thank you.
The Cloud DNS costs a few cents, each month. Also, any Egress data that you use over the 1GB costs a few cents per GB of data. Here is more info: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vpc/network-pricing">https://cloud.google.com/vpc/network-pricing</a> <br><br>Oh yeah, in my video, I used an SSD. I recommend you go back to a 30GB HDD to save money if you don&#39;t want the extra cost.<br><br>You can look at your bill and see what the breakdown is.
I run free vm but it generate bill
can you tell us how to access PhpMyAdmin in Google Cloud Platform?
Hi Michael Taiwan! Thanks for watching the tutorial! The old way of setting up the SSL (like in this tutorial) doesn&#39;t work anymore.

@UTECHPIA ohh Thanks very much for quick response. After I click on SSH after VM instances, it doesn&#39;t work and my WordPress website went down! Error &quot;can&#39;t find IP ADDRESS&quot; so I&#39;ll check if you have a new updated tutorial on your channel for NON TECHIES. Yes I subscribed! THANKS A LOT
GREAT BUT even if I skipped CDN Step 5, the SSL certificate still does NOT RENEW after one month and it&#39;s a pain to renew SSL<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG9kv5-5bPI&amp;t=7m38s">7:38</a> Step#3 SET IP<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG9kv5-5bPI&amp;t=12m12s">12:12</a> Step#4 CREATE SSL + RENEW SSL<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG9kv5-5bPI&amp;t=14m04s">14:04</a> Configure REDIRECT to HTTPS<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG9kv5-5bPI&amp;t=16m05s">16:05</a> Step#5 CDN, SKIP that part
Hi FORHAD RAHMAN, thanks for watching my video and thanks for your feedback. I did a TERRIBLE job at explaining this part. The estimate price on the Bitnami setup screen doesn&#39;t take into consideration that we&#39;re going to be taking advantage of Google&#39;s Free Tier. Since we are using a f1-micro CPU on (us-west1, us-central1, or us-east1), then the CPU is free. Here&#39;s more details of the free tier: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier">https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier</a> . Let me know if you have any other feedback, questions.
It will costs a few cents a month. As you said, 6.35$ per month after the free 300$ credit expiration? Please replay if you read this :/
Hi is the wordpress certified by Bitnami only meant for users in the US ?or Can it be used in asia like Singapore?
Hi George, I&#39;m sorry to hear you had to pay so much. Did you make sure to use the f1-micro VM instance? Also, did you make sure you only have 1 VM instance total? The Free tier allows up to 1GB of data Egress per month, it will be about $0.12/GB, which most people don&#39;t get that much use. Unless you are serving 833GB of data, I don&#39;t see how your bill can be $100. Can you show me your bill so I can help? Also, don&#39;t forget you can set up &quot;billing&quot; Alert, so that you get instant notification when your cost goes higher than $0.75/month (For example).
This tutorial is not real. I followed this example and everything worked but after just one month of hosting my Wordpress on Google Cloud I end up paying over one hundred dollars (over 100$). I have the invoice and the bill that I can prove to anyone who does not believe me. I am sure this guy was paid by Google to make this video. This video is a hoax.
Thanks for this detailed presentation. Very clean speaking, easy to understand :)
Hi Erfan, does the website still work if you access it via IP address?
@UTECHPIA yea, the website shows as per auto generated IP address, but after assigning customs url, it shows database error. Do I have to wait 48 hours?
for my case, the VM instance is deployed successfully, but after changing the name servers to assign my domain (which I bought from Goolge Domains as well, it shows &quot;Error establishing a database connection&quot;<br /><br />any idea what is wrong ?
Hi Evie, yes, you can 100% get adsense to your Wordpress website, it doesn&#39;t matter where your website is hosted. Please let me know if you have any other questions. BTW: If you haven&#39;t already done so, please consider subscribing to UTECHPIA. Thanks so much! Have a great day!
is it possible to get adsense to our wordpress website even if its host on google cloud platform???
God bless you! What a great step by step video. I love that you actually show us and tell us exactly what we need to do. I am going to save this video and follow along with it when I am more awake and alert. LOL. Thank you for making such a clear step by step video.
Hi Amanda, 100%, yes. Once you setup Wordpress, it will be exactly like if you hosted anywhere else! Now, there are a few things to consider here #1 the Free Tier allows up to 1GB of data egress (meaning data downloaded to your viewers), if you go over 1GB, then it&#39;s $0.12 per GB. The other thing to consider is #2: if you have LOTS of visitors like 1500 visits a day, then you will need to upgrade your Virtual Machine to handle the additional simultaneous load. But honestly, if you host ANYWHERE if you get this kind of traffic, they will make upgrade your hosting package as well. Also, if you&#39;re getting that many visitors, you&#39;ll be making lots and lots of money and can afford to upgrade your Google Cloud Virtual Machine to provide you customer a smoother experience. FYI: My other website is currently hosted on Google Cloud, and I am currently working to add the feature to sell products on my website, check out my new website here: <a href="http://www.pixelstabbers.com/">www.PixelStabbers.com</a>
With this free method, would I be able to accept payments from customers? I want to be able to sell my product through the website.

Hi Laurence, the user account is setup with a temporary user@<a href="http://example.com/">example.com</a> (or something like that). You&#39;ll need to setup WP Mail SMTP to configure emails being sent from Wordpress, and then you can verify/confirm an email address update. Please let me know if that answers your question. BTW: If you haven&#39;t already done so, please consider SUBSCRIBING TO UTECHPIA. Your support is totally appreciated. Have a great day, my friend! :)
Crazy question... I have completed all step and established the https... I copied over my word press password. Here’s the question...<br /><br />What email is the user acct setup with?
Hi Shakil, are you using CloudFlare? If so, then you set your mx records on cloudflare. Hope that helps! Good luck, my friend!
Need some help please.<br />I followed these steps to host my site. I had purchased a domain name with <a href="http://names.co.uk/">names.co.uk</a>. I pointed it to my website. Now I would like to have an email address for my domain name. I have chosen gsuite to keep it simple. You need to verify the domain to sign up to gsuite. Where do I do this from as it is not working from the <a href="http://names.co.uk/">names.co.uk</a> control panel.<br />Any ideas please. Google suite seems to thing the site is managed by Google domains
Hi! Check your username and password. Go to GCP -&gt; Deployment Manager to see the username and password again. Good luck, my friend!
UTECHPIA thank you very much <br>I already done that and also I have to admit that your video is one of the top educational video on YouTube that I have seen in recent years <br>Thanks for your help and good luck with next videos 💙
@247 Ymail Thanks for the kind words, are you able to log into your wordpress website now? Or still having trouble? Thanks!
UTECHPIA <br>I do and I successfully lunched my website and everything just work fine <br>Thanks for asking anyway 👍🏼
hI <br>I have created a project then I installed the bitnami certificate but why I can log in to my WordPress ?
You need to configure your email on the wordpress website. Use the WP SMTP email Plugin (it&#39;s pre-installed on the bitnami deployment). Here&#39;s how to set it up FOR FREE with Gmail: <a href="https://wpmailsmtp.com/docs/how-to-set-up-the-gmail-mailer-in-wp-mail-smtp/">https://wpmailsmtp.com/docs/how-to-set-up-the-gmail-mailer-in-wp-mail-smtp/</a> BTW: If you haven&#39;t already done so, please consider subscribing to UTECHPIA, your support would be totally appreciated! Have a great day, my friend! :)
Could you please tell me why this Wordpress website doesn’t send me the confirmation email ,I lost my password and I had do delete all the project and do everything again because that password on google platform is temporary !?
I recommend the one by Bitnami because they have lots of preinstalled components. It is the only option I&#39;ve used. BTW: If you haven&#39;t already done so, please consider subscribing to UTECHPIA, your support would be totally appreciated! Have a great day, my friend! :)
What about the Wordpress in marketplace do you recommend using it ?
Allegedly, your video is mindblowing, This is literally a superb video Thank you for such great help and guidance. You made something impossible possible.

The one Certified by Bitnami has more packages preinstalled that are needed with the popular Wordpress themes. They are also more recent versions of the packages. And lastly, the Bitnami community on the internet is huge, so they are great at answering technical questions, just Google &quot;Bitnami Wordpress&quot; and you&#39;ll see how big the community is :) BTW: If you haven&#39;t already done so, please consider subscribing to UTECHPIA, your support would be totally appreciated!

Great tutorial. Is there a reason why you pick Wordpress Certified By Bitnami instead of the regular Wordpress?
Hello everyone, <br /><br />Maybe you can help. I followed this video to couple Wordpress Hosting on google cloud platform for our website. The problem that I know have is that wordpress to update our plugins ask for the FTP credentials. Would you have any idea of what&#39;s going wrong? <br /><br />Kind regards, <br />Renaat

@UTECHPIA thanks, i found it :D i made a slight mistake. i have WP on the virtual machine, running great with SSL. now i was going to migrate my old WP website to this one, BUT, the domain name is the same and now my old website is probably gone? if i go back to my old hosting provider and change the nameservers back to the original ones, will i find my old site? if so i will use WP migration to save it to my desktop and repoint the site to the virtual drive on google and upload it. whaddya reckon?
Hi there. Great video 👍. One quick simple question. I can copy the code you left in the description, but I can&#39;t paste it 😭
Hi Eamonn, you should not have <b>anything</b> pointing to &quot;<a href="http://epiclightsource.com/">epiclightsource.com</a>&quot;. that is my example. I think you might have copied and paste the SSL commands and forgot to replace EpicLightSource with your own domain. Maybe you made a mistake and configured your name server to point to <b>MY</b> IP address instead of your own? There is NO RANDOM or anything, don&#39;t worry! :)
@UTECHPIA thanks for replying so soon. I&#39;ll re do the ssl, but I do remember replacing epic light with my domain. When creating the ssl, does it matter which email address is used? The only other thing I did was, I skipped step 5.
the weirdest thing just happened. i finished migrating the site to google using &quot;all in one WP migration&quot; everything looked great, my ssl was working great, i could google my domain name and click on the search result and get to my site, now running on google cloud. everything looked perfect until i attempted to log in to my WP dashboard. i kept getting error messages mentioning <a href="http://www.epiclightsource.com/">www.epiclightsource.com</a>. i couldnt for the life of me get into the site and eventually gave up and repointed the nameservers to the old ones. now im back without ssl and utterly confused. i freaked out a little when i was locked out of my WP dashboard as i thought i was locked out and going to be held to ransom. im afraid to repoint the nameservers now. :(

hello<br />How do i renew the SSL?? it says SSL expired.
Awesome tutorial... but can I do it in Malaysia?
Great video
Great video but please add the steps to renew the SSL certificate. I added some comments below but here is the what I did to renew the SSL certificate (it expires in three months so you have to repeat it). The one that worked was: 1) use this command: sudo /opt/bitnami/bncert-tool 2) agree to continue and click Y <br />Here&#39;s some more information on it: <a href="https://docs.bitnami.com/google/how-to/generate-install-lets-encrypt-ssl/">https://docs.bitnami.com/google/how-to/generate-install-lets-encrypt-ssl/</a>

Hello, I love you teaching. Pls am having issues with adding my email address on my Bitnami Wordpress dashboard hosted on google cloud platform. When I add the email address and save, it does not reflect. Same thing when I try to change password from the Bitnami generated one. Guide me pls.
Nice video, very well explained.<br />Do you know how much traffic this server can handle?<br />Do you have an estimate of how many visits a day we can have with this setup?
Thank you so much. It was a scary 1 hour I spent on going through the steps but everything worked! Amazing. There are so many exceptions and details in everything you do. So rare to find something this complicated but works.
Hi Bam Boo, thanks for watching my video and thanks for your feedback. I did a TERRIBLE job at explaining this part. The estimate price on the Bitnami setup screen doesn&#39;t take into consideration that we&#39;re going to be taking advantage of Google&#39;s Free Tier.

Let me know if you have any other feedback, questions.
@UTECHPIA it was clear and understood that the free tier costs nothing. However, it was clearly visible on the screen at the time of choosing the WordPress installation, that that is not free, it costs money, and not once only, but every month. For WP, as I understand, it does not matter WHERE you install it, they want to get paid simply for the fact that you use their template. Right?
Did I miss something? The Wordress Bitnami installation was costing about $6 per month, so how is this entire setup only a few cents per year?

Hi Yogendran Ganesan. Thanks for checking out the video. I did a bad job explaining this point, here let me try again: Google gives you $300 Free credit to use in the first year. Also, I discuss how to configure your Bitnami WordPress Deployment so that you can take advantage of Google Free Tier (basically using the f1-micro CPU in specific regions). So even after the first year, you&#39;re only paying about $0.50 a month for it (actual cost varies based on how much traffic you get). The Bitnami wordpress estimate cost is not correct, since they don&#39;t factor in that we are setting up to take advantage of the Free Tier. Please let me know if you have any questions. Have a great day, my friend!
Can anyone share what is the bill once the Free Tier is maxed out or after a year period is over please? Interested to know that please.

The shortcut that is created on the desktop is not the right program. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLEIyR9OuaQ&amp;t=605s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLEIyR9OuaQ&amp;t=605s</a>

Great video.....only suggestion that I would add....is how to migrate your wordpress from a hosting service (for example using All-In-One WP Migration Plugin)

Hi Jasbier Kapoor, thanks for watching my video. I did a TERRIBLE job at explaining this part. The estimate price on the Bitnami setup screen doesn&#39;t take into consideration that we&#39;re going to be taking advantage of Google&#39;s Free Tier. Since we are using a f1-micro CPU on (us-west1, us-central1, or us-east1), then the CPU is free. Here&#39;s more details of the free tier: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier">https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier</a> . Keep in mind that if you have lot of ingress data, you still need to pay for that, but it&#39;s cheap, like $0.12 per Gigabyte! Let me know if you have any other feedback or questions.
How much does it cost?
Hi Jasbier Kapoor! Thanks for watching the tutorial! YOU ARE RIGHT :) The old way of setting up the SSL (like in this tutorial) doesn&#39;t work anymore. I recommend using the new method, using this command: sudo /opt/bitnami/bncert-tool <br />Here&#39;s some more information on it: <a href="https://docs.bitnami.com/google/how-to/generate-install-lets-encrypt-ssl/">https://docs.bitnami.com/google/how-to/generate-install-lets-encrypt-ssl/</a><br />Good luck! BTW: If you haven&#39;t already subscribed to UTECHPIA, please consider doing so. Thanks!
Hey @UTECHPIA , I have already used the new method and got my SSL certificate. I was just informing you so that you can update your video.
@Jasbier Kapoor , Thanks for the reminder. Much appreciated, my friend! :)
hello boss, your &quot;install free SSL on Google cloud platform&quot; is outdated and not working. Please update.
That step can take up to 24 hours. Has it worked yet?
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG9kv5-5bPI&amp;t=12m05s">12:05</a> the DNS security stuff see it just sends me to error 404...
Thank the Lord for Asians....
how we can send messages in contact form
Nice video and it really helped me a lot I just have one concern though cause everytime I try to remove the bitnami banner and enter the command sudo /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/bnconfig --disable_banner 1 it always give me an error saying command not found. I would really appreciate if you can help me with this :)
Hi! Thanks for watching my video and thanks for leaving a comment! Below are my answers to your questions:<br />A1: Most websites have less than 1GB of traffic a month, if you have less than 1GB of traffic it is FREE. It is about $0.12 per additional 1GB of data per month.<br />A2: I&#39;m a Google Certified Professional Cloud Architect. I&#39;ve been working with Google Cloud Platform to engineer and manage solutions for several years.<br />A3: If you are not technical, I would not recommend this solution. <br />A4: Sorry, I am not providing such service at this time. <br /><br />Please let me know if you have any other questions! <br /><br />BTW: If you haven&#39;t already done so, please consider SUBSCRIBING TO UTECHPIA. Your support is totally appreciated. Have a great day, my friend! :)
Question 1: How many pennies per month does it really cost? <br />Question 2: What is your technical qualification for you to do stuff like this? <br />Question 3: If you are none technical, would this approach make sense if you run into problems weeks or months in the future? How would you solve them? <br />Question 4: If I send you my domain name would you set up and manage this service for me?
Hi Mike, try this: <br /><br />Open your httpd-app.conf for editing by running the following command:<br /><br />sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/conf/httpd-app.conf<br /><br />Once inside the file, locate the following line:<br /><br />Include “/opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/conf/banner.conf”<br /><br />Next, comment out the line by adding a # symbol in front of it – as shown:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23include">#Include</a> “/opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/conf/banner.conf”<br /><br />Next, save and exit the file (CTRL+X then CTRL+Y), and restart your Apache server by running the following command:<br /><br />sudo /opt/bitnami/<a href="http://ctlscript.sh/">ctlscript.sh</a> restart
Hi, great tutorial! I need some help though, i suspect disabling the banner has also disabled certain banners on my themes as well. Is there a way to only specifically disable the bitnami banner only?
There is a way to use Cluodflare and Let&#39;sEncrypt, you can find the method here: <a href="https://infosec.theos-blog.com/renewing-letsencrypt-certificate-when-using-cloudflare/">https://infosec.theos-blog.com/renewing-letsencrypt-certificate-when-using-cloudflare/</a> and thanks for the awesome tutorial @Utechipia
Amazing tutorial.... really great content. After one year of trial, how can I renew my license?
thanks for the tutorial, unfortunately I can&#39;t install my theme because it probably occupies about 60 megs, how can I increase the size quote on wordpress?
thank you :3
Hi Sabreen Rezvie! Thanks for watching the tutorial!

Hi Emre Cullu! Wordpress is generally very efficient, so it doesn&#39;t need a lot of memory. However, I recommend creating a second GCP account to host the other site separately. So that you can take advantage of the Free Tier for each site. Thanks so much for taking the time to watch the video and leaving such a nice comment! Please let me know if you have any questions.

David, thank you for this excellent tutorial. You&#39;re a fantastic educator. I can&#39;t even imagine how much time this video saved me. I normally dislike these kinds of setup tasks with many variables, but your expert guidance made the process straightforward, rewarding, and even fun. Bravo!
If one does this, what would be the best way to go about setting up email accounts for that domain?

Hi Lucas Tan! When you say the VM is upgraded, do you mean simply upgrade the CPU and/or RAM? If it&#39;s just a CPU/memory upgrade, then you do NOT have to repeat the whole process, just stop your VM, Select your new VM hardware, and start the new VM back up! :) Please let me know if you have any other questions. Thanks!
@UTECHPIA Thanks for looking into the comment. Yeah that&#39;s what I was asking.

Good info thank you. If the VM is upgraded would you still have to repeat the whole process?
Waaay to many anachronisms....
If you don&#39;t want to pay anything, try to see if you can get your website to fit WITHIN the FREE Tier, it has been updated: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_uz06w5xt8&amp;list=PLFBOf6mkjEzLdCYcyYzI4gRqSy9oVOVJU&amp;index=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_uz06w5xt8&amp;list=PLFBOf6mkjEzLdCYcyYzI4gRqSy9oVOVJU&amp;index=1</a><br /><br />However, you don&#39;t want to use GCP and want to close out your account, at your GCP Dashboard page, you can go to Project&#39;s and DELETE or &quot;TRASH&quot; your project. Hope that helps :)
So if I&#39;ve done something like this all the way to a published page, HOW do I reverse this and back out of it and not incur charges after the period of time.????

Awesome Video! I&#39;m only hosting my content on google which is a subdomain. Do I still use my main domain in the certificate command? IE:<br /><br />sudo /opt/bitnami/letsencrypt/scripts/<a href="http://generate-certificate.sh/">generate-certificate.sh</a> -m myemail -d <a href="http://mydomain.com/">mydomain.com</a> -d <a href="http://content.mydomain.com/">content.mydomain.com</a> <br /><br />Or do I do something else?
Super Helpful! Thanks so much!
I always love watching your videos.

hey It says command not found on step 4 . Anything wrong with what I am doing?``````````````````````````
Update for Step 5: Removing the Bitnami Banner - the terminal script should be: &#39;sudo /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/bnconfig.disabled --disable_banner 1&#39;
We need the same but 2 gears down......speed....and drifting not allowed.
Hi Wall street in Wall street, thanks for watching my video and thanks for your feedback. I did a TERRIBLE job at explaining this part.

No my friend your video is just amazing.

Hi DJ Only-Vibe! Thanks for your comment, GCP really can be 100% FREE. GCP has a generous free tier (please see the break down here: <a href="https://youtu.be/fJJL9icHCxY?t=65">https://youtu.be/fJJL9icHCxY?t=65</a> ). I have been running several websites running this way for almost two years now. But you need to keep an eye on your egress data. We have a Learning Management System website (www.PixelStabbers.com) that is still perfectly fine on the free tier. For our other websites that have more static content like <a href="http://utechpia.com/">UTECHPIA.com</a> and <a href="http://kidphotofun.com/">KidPhotoFun.com</a> those Websites are way under the minimum of the GCP’s free tier. Please feel free to let me know if you have any other questions. Thanks!
@UTECHPIA what’s the best way to reach out to you?

What&#39;s the big difference between using Google Cloud Platform as my WordPress Hosting than using Other WordPress Hosting Like Bluehost, Ionos, WPEngine Etc?<br />HOW MUCH DOES IT REALLY COST MONTH OR YEARLY TO KEEP MY WEBSITE RUNNING ON THE GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM? <br /><br />I have 4 diffrent Website can I add all of them on one Google Cloud Account? Do I also have to pay for each website individually Monthly Or Yearly?
Hi Matthew. Somewhere in your setup you are pointing to <a href="http://www.epiclightsource.com/">www.EpicLightSource.com</a> you need to change that to your actual website.

Hello David
 <br />Thank you so much for the timely response. I actually can&#39;t trace where I made that mistake but I think it could be the code I copied from your youtube video and pasted without editing.<br />Should I delete the project? Should I delete VM instances?? Please advise me on how I can correct it.
 <br />
 <br />Thank you once again.

@UTECHPIA Yes sir, I&#39;ll take a look at the link you sent tomorrow. I&#39;m trying to finish my python on line course, that is driving me crazy, which seem to be a short drive anymore.
@Thomas Rucker , wow, you are a software developer too!? I&#39;d love to check out your Python course! I wish you all the best! Happy Holidays!
@UTECHPIA I&#39;m not a developer, I&#39;m a network administrator. All switch and routers have python installed into the ISO. So instead of me logging into every switch and router, I use Python to automate the changes. I also use powershell to automate new exchange personal into AD. I do not have the patience to be a developer. As for the websites it&#39;s just for fun. :-)
@UTECHPIA Another question; I setup my website email through Google Workspace. That starting to look expensive. What do you use?
I want to thank you again. I saved this as a favorite and I&#39;m glad I did. I installed a plugin called Suberb Themes, don&#39;t do it! I was hopping to get more control out of one of there wordpress themes. It fucked everything up, I could not manage images, NONE, no matter what theme I chose. I could not uninstall the plugin, I&#39;m still fighting for a refund! <br /><br />In the end I delete the VM and started over, fuck!<br /><br />I did everything that I did the first time, but my domain kept going to the wrong IP address???<br /><br /><br />So I went through this video again, bingo, google domains! Yes in the night my domain was transferred form hostmonster to google. It was in there I found the DNS record, updated to the new IP address, I&#39;m good now!

​@UTECHPIA I remembered seeing a message in SSH about a new the new tool. I used the details in your three new videos for most of my migration, but used this older video for ssl. My mistake. I will watch the newer videos again and configure &quot;bncert-tool&quot;. <br />Thanks so much again!<br />ps: if you would like to see my site it is: <a href="https://ez-et.com/">https://ez-et.com</a>
​@UTECHPIA Hi again, I ran the sudo /opt/bitnami/bncert-tool command but got an error (that was probably caused by me using the old tutorial, not the new one) Oh well, everything seems to be working fine on my site. Thanks to your great tutorials!<br /><br />I think the error has to do with letsencript cert to renew every month. My letsencript license next to my url in chrome says my license expires 02-Apr-21.<br />But today I received a message from bitnami support saying how to &quot;How to Run the Bitnami Support Tool in a cloud image or virtual machine&quot;. I will do that and see what happens. <br /><br />===========================<br />The following is the text from SSH that includes the error...<br /><br />Performing changes to your installation
 <br />The Bitnami HTTPS Configuration Tool will perform any necessary actions to your 
 <br />Bitnami installation. This may take some time, please be patient.

@UTECHPIA Hi, mea again. Good news. Hi, <br />I took a wild guess and entered in wp-config.php ...
 <br />define(&#39;WP_SITEURL&#39;, &#39;<a href="https://ez-et.com/&#39;);">https://ez-et.com/&#39;);
 </a><br />define(&#39;WP_HOME&#39;, &#39;<a href="https://ez-et.com/&#39;);">https://ez-et.com/&#39;);
 </a><br />
 <br />And ran &quot;sudo /opt/bitnami/bncert-tool&quot; again and no errors. I figured it was dumb mistake on my part. I am just learning.
 <br />
 <br />Just one question. When I look at the letsencrypt cert in Chrome (next to my url), it still says expire date 02-Arp-21. Is that normal and it update automatically?
Hi, this has been so helpful. But I have a problem where my wordpress site is now loading as &quot;https://www&quot; not &quot;https://&quot; (url shouldn&#39;t include www)<br />Probably an easy fix. Any info would be so much appreciated. Thanks :-)

I have had a couple of ssl not auto renew with selecting yes for the cronjob<br /><br />I put the site on Cloudflare which gives ssl for year and the cdn benefits.<br /><br />I have heard the micro vm will top out at about a thousand users at once.<br /><br />Have you had one crash out from overuse yet?<br /><br />Cool video thanks<br /><br />Regards from Ramsgate

@UTECHPIA thank you for your reply, <br />though the playlist you send me has nothing about SSL renew, in the part video at the end you said that it will be discussed in the next video but there is no part3, the 3d video in the playlist talk about migration :(.<br />also, I tried using the /opt/bitnami/bncert-tool<br />and it detected that I already have a certificate but I end up with the following error:<br />Warning: The domain &#39;x.com&#39; resolves to a different IP address than the <br /><br />one detected for this machine, which is &#39;x.x.x.x&#39;. Please fix its DNS 
 <br />entries or remove it.
@doobara , you can download the PDF (at the end of video 2) that shows you how to use the bncert-tool and build your VM from scratch. <br /><br />If possible, I recommend building your VM from scratch. It is possible to fix your current VM by undoing what you did using the old tool, but it&#39;s a bit tricky. Sorry I cannot provide that level of support. Good luck, my friend!
@UTECHPIA np Thank you :)
how to renew ssh when it is expired?
Hi crypto joe! Thanks for watching the tutorial!

@UTECHPIA Thank you so much.
At the WordPress launch, I get the message of Bitnami requiring a project with billing, does google cloud deduce the amount from my bank account or from the $300 offered?<br />I want to try this and see if it&#39;s faster than Namecheap chared hosting.
You can certainly use Gsuite with Cloud DNS. But I don&#39;t recommend using Cloud DNS anymore, this is an old tutorial. Please see the updated tutorial here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFBOf6mkjEzLdCYcyYzI4gRqSy9oVOVJU">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFBOf6mkjEzLdCYcyYzI4gRqSy9oVOVJU</a> <br>Let me know if you have any questions!

@UTECHPIA thanks man, lets check the updated one then. highly appreciated. :)
@UTECHPIA I checked all 3 videos of your suggested playlist. You just said you&#39;ll make a 3rd video for the DNS setup &amp; then you made a totally different video of WordPress migration &amp; also I checked the other videos, that 3rd video was never aired. <br><br>it sucks !!!
@IFTEKHAR I ASIF , Hello, My Friend! You can grab the free PDF at the end of video #2 that explains all the steps in video #3. Hope you are able to follow all the steps and make an amazing website. Best of luck, my friend.
@UTECHPIA ops, sorry i missed the pdf first. i tried it &amp; everything worked fine now. <br><br>I am sorry for the misunderstanding &amp; thanks a ton for making awesome contents. :)
@IFTEKHAR I ASIF , awesome! Have a great weekend, my friend! 👍
@UTECHPIA hi friend, now I&#39;ve two questions to you. <br><br>1) How to enter PhPMyAdmin Easily from Google Cloud because I can&#39;t change the default username or email. <br><br>2) Is it possible to control this wordpress management by git version control + vscode workflow?
@IFTEKHAR I ASIF , Hi friend! Unfortunate your questions are beyond the scope of this video. The easy way change the default username and email is to figure the plugin: &quot;WP Mail SMTP by WPForms&quot;, and then you can update the email address, and make changes to the password.
I am using G Suite with my Google Domains. <br />Now when I am trying to change it to a custom nameserver, Google is disabling the webmail. <br /><br />By the way, before GCP, I used to use Namecheap hosting. That time I just added the IP added in the resource record &amp; it worked fine. But for cloud DNS, I tried so &amp; It didn&#39;t work. <br /><br />So, is there any way that I can add custom nameservers in the resource record manually?

Does the SSL pass work today?
How, I&#39;m having trouble adding a subdomain to this Google host platform, my main domain DNS is already hosted by another hosting company who did it for free for me, but they would only do it for free for 1 page as a promotion, that&#39;s why I want to host my subdomain with the same DNS on Google Cloud, but I seemed to have messed it up...

Hi!! Thank you for such a great video! But can you please show in detail how to migrate Opencart store from Xamp locallhost to Google Cloud platform, please! It will be very valuable!
Hi, I recently had to migrate my website due to having to update my PHP. I also had to go back to this video while setting up my domain to my new IP address and had to create new DSNs.(I know there is an updated instructions and I already downloaded it, but still needed the visual from this video for the DNS section.) After waiting 48 hours as recommended, I tried typing in my website address and came up with this Privacy Error:<br /><br />Your connection is not private
 <br />Attackers might be trying to steal your information from &quot;My domain name was here&quot; (for example, passwords, messages, or credit cards). Learn more
 <br />NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID<br /><br /><br />I am not sure what to do next to get rid of this warning and move to the next step (creating a new SSL certificate). Please help. Thank you ahead of time.
Hi P Costopoulos! Thanks for your comment, GCP really can be 100% FREE. GCP has a generous free tier (please see the break down here: <a href="https://youtu.be/fJJL9icHCxY?t=65">https://youtu.be/fJJL9icHCxY?t=65</a> ). I have been running several websites running this way for almost two years now. But you need to keep an eye on your egress data. We have a Learning Management System website (www.PixelStabbers.com) that is still perfectly fine on the free tier. For our other websites that have more static content like <a href="http://utechpia.com/">UTECHPIA.com</a> and <a href="http://kidphotofun.com/">KidPhotoFun.com</a> those Websites are way under the minimum of the GCP’s free tier. Please feel free to let me know if you have any other questions. Thanks!
Hi, i&#39;ve done a site with your steps on the Google Cloud, it&#39;s all good. But can i ask; you say it costs a few dollars a year with this system, but not really, as when the Google trial credits run out, the Bitnami Wordpress deployment is around US$20 per month per deployment ?
Muy buen, video, Consulta como puedo hacer para ver el CPanel?

How do I remove the user blog
Hi John guo, thanks for watching my video and thanks for your feedback. I did a TERRIBLE job at explaining this part. The estimate price on the Bitnami setup screen doesn&#39;t take into consideration that we&#39;re going to be taking advantage of Google&#39;s Free Tier. Since we are using a f1-micro CPU on (us-west1, us-central1, or us-east1), then the CPU is free. Here&#39;s more details of the free tier: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier">https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier</a> . Let me know if you have any other feedback, questions.
It is not free. It will charge $15 per month
I got the error. &quot;The attempted action failed. Please try again.&quot; when I created DNS address. I have tried more than 20 times. Do you know what wrong? Thank you
Hi John guo! Thanks for watching the tutorial! The old way of setting up the SSL (like in this tutorial) doesn&#39;t work anymore. I recommend using the new method, using this command: sudo /opt/bitnami/bncert-tool <br />Here&#39;s some more information on it: <a href="https://docs.bitnami.com/google/how-to/generate-install-lets-encrypt-ssl/">https://docs.bitnami.com/google/how-to/generate-install-lets-encrypt-ssl/</a><br /><br />Good luck! BTW: If you haven&#39;t already subscribed to UTECHPIA, please consider doing so. Thanks!
Thank you very much. I will try it.
How to fix the problem The htaccess.conf (/conf/htaccess.conf/) file is not writable. You can either use the WordPress redirect, add the rules manually? Thank you
Hi John guo! I recommend a separate Google Cloud Platform account to SAVE MONEY... But if you want to create a second website on the same GCP account, you can repeat the procedure for the first website, JUST know that the FREE Tier does NOT apply to the second deployment.

Can you add a tutorial to setup second website with single cloud google account?
Hi John, sorry I don&#39;t know how to get FREE business email. You can use Zoho Free Business Email, but it&#39;s not as secure as Gmail, I rather just use gmail, unless you are ready to play with Gsuite: <a href="https://goo.gl/Af7oWc">https://goo.gl/Af7oWc</a>

Can I re-run the generate SSL certificate to fix SSL expiration?
Hi Radu, you&#39;ll need to configure your MX records for email. As long as you have your MX records your emails should work properly.
@UTECHPIA so only MX records configuration in the Google Console and no other configurations in the Google Domains area, correct? :)
will the email still work if you update the NS records in the DNS section of Google Domains?
Yes on the Free Tier. Anything over that is paid
@Tony Teaches Tech just for small site :)
1gb transfer only?
noob server it just love to hang.........

@UTECHPIA after testing all and found out it limit by 1 gb transfer bro.. thanks for the unlimited plugin anyway...
@CyberMania , wait, what do you mean 1GB transfer limit? Are you talking about data egress? Or are you talking about backup and restore?
no connection from china as well ....lol
@CyberMania , ohhh, that&#39;s not a limit, that&#39;s the small fee you pay for data egress, it&#39;s a lot of money... But BECAREFUL it will add up.
tested and it love to hang.... no respond.............

@UTECHPIA thanks for the quick reply. Your new video link explains the &quot;Bitnami and Automatic&quot; which I had deployed already and ended up Free hosting as well. Maybe there is another video/link? In any case, my only issue is that my alias email forwarding from my Google Domains stopped working once adding the four Coud name servers as custom name servers for my domain. I am getting this error on Google Domains: &quot;All settings for this domain are disabled and can’t be changed. To enable them, restore the default Google Domains name servers&quot;. I appreciate your help.
@alendavoudian , the new method doesn&#39;t use Google Cloud DNS anymore. Ultimately, where you setup your actual DNS, that&#39;s where you want to put your MX records for your email.
great video. very helpful, thanks. I successfully installed Wordpress on GCP with these instructions, but now my email forwarding from my Google Domains stopped working. It is asking to restore Google Domains name servers which I changed to Cloud DNS in step #3.

@UTECHPIA okay thanks brother what things should i change on the cloud flare and put my ip address on
if my site already on Cloudflare should I put GCP IP address on the cloud flare not the domain provider?
That&#39;s exactly I am looking for. Thanks for sharing!
This video is super helpful! I wish I could find your video guide months ago when I setup my WP in GCP. I didn&#39;t choose us-west-1 zone in the initial setup. I can change the Machine Type to f1-micro, but can&#39;t find a way to change Zone (currently in us-west2). Anyway I can change Zone of VM instance? Thanks!

How much is it per month after the 1 year trial ?
Thank you, for the video, first of all. I have a dilemma. I had a real bad webhost who sent my website in a zip file. I was not quick to get it renewed my domain name. I went with two webhosts. The second one was going to migrate my site for free, till they found out I have a .net, instead of a .com, same name, and all. They said that I would have to clone it, and that is not free to do with them. Should I try to retrieve my site, it has like 6-7 subdomains, also. Should I purchase a .com, or a .co, from namecheap, or google, and try to do it, again. However, I still cannot even open it in google drive. I had gotten so discouraged, that it took me, a very long time, to even trust, another webhost. I am not sure, if I should give up on my project, for if I did not have a lot of wasted good content on it. It is absurd, but it is up from hundreds, to thousands, of dollars, for anyone to buy. It is very scary because now I do have a website actually two of them, with my name on them, perhaps something that I might regret later on down the road. What are your suggestions? I greatly appreciate them.
Can someone please help me with step 4, after typing the command<br /> sudo /opt/bitnami/letsencrypt/scripts/<a href="http://generate-certificate.sh/">generate-certificate.sh</a> -m epiclightsource@<a href="http://gmail.com/">gmail.com</a> -d <a href="http://epiclightsource.com/">epiclightsource.com</a> -d <a href="http://www.epiclightsource.com/">www.epiclightsource.com</a> (using my own &quot;domain&quot; and &quot;Gmail&quot;) it&#39;s just stating command not found. I already tried to change the DNS server back to its original before typing the command but still command is not yet found.
Thanks sir, your tutorial increases my knowledge
i cant get the ssl cert to generate said command not found

Thank you. for google cloud platflorm.
Thanks a lot.
isn&#39;T that what Googles Container OS Image in GCE is for?
@Imran Zunzani of course you’re right, thanks for clarifying
@Christian Baumann <br />Google&#39;s Container OS is for the instance on which Kubernetes or Docker runs, while Alpine is for creating the container (image) to run on Kubernetes/Docker.<br />Google&#39;s Container OS reduces the attack surface for the machine on which you run containers while bases like Alpine reduces the attack surface for the containers themselves.
👍<br />Also use the minimal container base image eg. Alpine, to reduce attack surface due to vulnerabilities.
I was thinking the same hmm!
&quot;Top 3&quot; ;-)
They are phasing that one out it seems to me.
You did not mention GAE Flex 🤔
if they did not give it away, it would not have democratized the cloud, all clouds, public, private, and hybrid. the beauty of K8s is it abstracted all these platforms, and enabled new platforms to built on top of it. e.g. Knative or in GCP Cloud run.
My personal view (TM), is that Cloud Run sounds like where things are headed. I know kubernetes Ok but feel like it&#39;s rather complex for what it does. As a developer, I don&#39;t want to manage kubernetes through a manifest, I have my smooth running docker images and just want to run them and let the cloud provider deal with the logistics and give me a nice web or platform UI that lets me &quot;tune&quot; how the containers run. The UI should be complete, and simple and fast, with alerts and limits I can set. That&#39;s my opinion only and does not reflect the opinions of anyone else I know including past, present or future employers.
I like it that you like GKE! It will only get better with time!
Sometimes I feel that you guys gave away too much by open-sourcing K8S. Honestly - it&#39;s an absolutely amazing tool, using something like &quot;Cloud Run&quot; feels like a step-back sometimes, like you are trying to get back control of your customers. GKE is such a perfect middle-ground between &quot;do it yourself&quot; and &quot;fully hosted&quot; option - I&#39;m not even sure there could be any product that would make it sensible to switch to something else. Any &quot;auxiliary&quot; tools, like CloudRegistry, Logging, Debug, Cloud Code are highly appreciated, but K8S API definitely MUST be the core part of it - and no one will be giving away that much of control, now since we&#39;ve seen what&#39;s possible!
I was thinking just the same. App Engine Flexible supports deployments of Docker conatiners.
What about AppEngine Flexible Environment?
👍👍👍
Thank you, it was very useful video for me.
Google is gonna be green gains gang tomorrow
Cloud is not Google&#39;s core business, not by a mile! It has been given 3 years to prove it is a viable separate business, as compared to the cashflow rich stars like Ads. It does not stand a chance unless Alphabet can somehow spin it off or The Federal Government breaks up Alphabet via Anti-trust. Azure &amp; IBM will not let it win in the Enterprise &amp; AWS wont let it win in the broader consumer market. Trying to be in 2nd or 3rd position everywhere, with so much internal Google viability competition, is not a smart strategy. Google will shut it down in 3-4 years.
Very good !

Hi
yo
what we going to do tonight?
@Matthew Pickettt
Hi
@Android Kenobi ?????
Ricky Freeman hi
hi

Rickie Strowbridge what the heck
I&#39;m kinda sad this isn&#39;t a live stream or YouTube premiere …
Confidential Computing Sounds interesting..
Yes
Excellent! keynote messages from both Google Leaders.
Interesting. I&#39;m looking forward for the infrastructure and app modernization sessions.
Thank you Dr. Thomas Kurian for sharing your insights with our community.
Thank you for this
Thank you so much for these upcoming training sessions :) I am very excited to be a part of this.
Nice!
Awesome!
BigQuery Omni would be breaker of this cloud next!!
Sir when is launced Jio Google 4g phone and price....?
Nice presentation which gives a good overview of what is currently available &amp; possible using GCP.<br />Future of work will be more digital (increased adoption of cloud), collaborative and flexible. &quot;serendipitous encounters&quot; - what Tony Hsieh calls &quot;Collisions&quot;.
I am adding this comment to seek some help from people who could help me out on getting a reply from Google Cloud Certification support who are not reachable by whatever way you try. In fact there is just one option to reach them i.e via online web form. Please checkout this thread and let me know if someone can help. <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/thread/59880000?hl=en">https://support.google.com/accounts/thread/59880000?hl=en</a>
The concept of BigQuery Omni will have a huge impact.
I want to be the next cto at google cloud
Interesting and confident speech.
The world is way too diverse than you can think of with a racist mind Avidya.
@Elon Musk so what u think he did at IIT???
Yet the founders are Americans who are the original brains<br />Also remember Sundar Pichai is not an engineer
@Truth Prevails Just nothing other than hobby
@Truth Prevails his engineering is absolutely worthless for his career but I sure it gave him lot logical and thinking skills
I don&#39;t want to brag about this or anything but Pichai and Kurian are of Indian origin and also Kurian (twin brother of NetApp CEO, George Kurian) is from Kerala, my home state in India. <br />Adipoli !! (Malayalam for extra-ordinary/super/excellent)
Excellent

When I&#39;m trying to authenticate my card with Google cloud I&#39;m getting this error.
 <br>
 <br>Your card doesn&#39;t support automatic recurring payments [QR-CC3ST-02].
 <br>
 <br>I got my otp and I had successfully authenticated.
 <br>
 <br>I also got message from my bank saying that my authentication is successful.
 <br>
 <br>Still Google is keep saying above error.
 <br>
 <br>Now my card isn&#39;t verified.
 <br>
 <br>I contacted the bank and they said no error from their side.
 <br>
 <br>I also tried with an other card too, but still getting this error.
 <br>
 <br>What would be the reason?

Reason is your card not enable for recurring. use credit card

You are motivation!!!
You&#39;re right. More to come!
Above you go legend
We need more Kaggle competitions vídeos!!
Yo Edet! I&#39;ve been working/studying/training/creating! Where do you think is best for a community? Here on YouTube? Or somewhere else?
@Daniel Bourke discord is cool or slack,but i prefer discord
hey where have u been long time?we still need a community so that we can stay in touch
@sumit misra how to get the certification?
Massive effort Sumit! Keep getting after it!
It&#39;s worth For Handsome salary in India??
Congratulations Man<br />I also got my Applied Data Science Specializations Certificate too From Coursera this week.....
For the majority, yes. Coursera have paid for some when I’ve partnered with them.
@Daniel Bourke how did you get the partnership with them? :)
@Daniel Bourke is the courses worth the prices?
They saw my videos and sent me an email asking if I’d like to partner for some future creations, I said yes :)
Yes. I wouldn’t have passed the exam without them.
@Daniel Bourke thanks for the answers man :D appreciate it
Do you pay for all your coursera courses ? :)
It’s great, very aligned to what I do on a day to day in terms of dealing with dataframes and manipulating them for insights. Professionally it is viewed as a valuable asset however not as valuable as having a project where you have demonstrated what you have learned throughout the course
@Daniel Bourke thanks for the aswer daniel , i wish you the best of luck is ur professional career
Daniel how much do you rate the applied data science coursera spesialization ? and how is it viewed professionally in ur country is it a big plus ? and congrats for the new certification
Thank you Vitaliy!
Awesome, Daniel! Congrats!!!!
It&#39;s worth the skills in cloud computing combined with data engineering but if you are looking for data science job asap, it&#39;s not priority. I think this should translate to what he says.
It is worth it to me as it applies to the role I’m currently in. Cloud computing skills are becoming essentially for any data scientist/engineer. Best to look into some of your ideal roles and decide if a Professional Certification lines up to where you want to be
Is it worth it? I mean does it help someone who is pursuing a career in data science?
@Daniel Bourke what&#39;s your educational background? and also as a second year student in university wanting to go into data science and eventually a machine learning engineer, when should I start preparing for these types of certifications. And what skills do I need before getting a GCP certificate.
Daniel Bourke I may have to try it
Hey Lucky! Thank you 🙏 <br />My math skill is about a 3/10 for where I’d like it to be. I’ve been looking at Math for Machine Learning on Coursera (cost) as well as computational linear algebra by Rachel Thomas on YouTube (free). Kahn Academy has also been great for all kinds of math.<br />Sort of related, I’ve been looking at the Think Stats book by Alan Downey for statistics with Python (it’s free)!
@Daniel Bourke Okay, Thanks ;)
@zeffery I studied food science at university and self-taught myself machine learning and artificial intelligence via here: <a href="https://bit.ly/AIMastersDegree">https://bit.ly/AIMastersDegree</a><br /><br />you should start preparing for these certifications if the specific role you&#39;re going for requires them - many data scientists and machine learning engineer role will require cloud skills<br /><br />best to start by putting what you&#39;re learning at university to work in one of your own projects and using cloud technologies along the way
Hi, Congrats!<br />How well is your math skill? Can u suggest me an online math course that u&#39;ve taken or u liked :)
Check this out, it&#39;s a video titled &quot;Machine Learning and Data Science with Kaggle&quot;: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6INvZ1TJ7b8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6INvZ1TJ7b8</a>
We need kaggle for beginner Daniel
Congratulations...
Hey Hammad! Thank you brother 👊<br />AWS is definitely the market leader in cloud and they have plenty of certifications. I did Google because it’s the platform I prefer at the moment. AWS is still incredibly valuable though.<br />I’d check them both out and see which one suits your style. They offer largely the same thing.<br />I’m currently learning more about AWS at work too, there aren’t too many of our clients which all use the same cloud.
Hi Daniel, awesome video, I am planning to learn some cloud computing this summer. Is there also a AWS cloud computing certificate? Do you have any recommendation if I should start with AWS or google cloud?
Thank you Bianca! That means a lot :)
Not only your technical skills but also your storytelling skills are getting better and better, Daniel. This was another great video. Fun and helpful at the same time.
Use ICICI debit card with international transactions enabled on it. I was working with Firebase and had to setup a billing account at Google Cloud Platform and I used Icici debit card which worked.
Hey Sachin! Thank you for the kind words. <br />The exam I took was all practical based multi-choice. As in, there were two case studies and you had answer questions like:<br />“Based on what you’ve read about company X, what setup should they go for?”<br />A. Big table, cloud storage..<br />B. Big query, cloud spanner<br />...<br />...<br />And you’d have to pick the best setup based on the information. However, this has changed since March 29 but the new exam style is listed on the certification page, I think they’ve taken away the case studies but it’s still multi-choice.<br /><br />Updated exam guidelines: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/certification/guides/data-engineer-2/">https://cloud.google.com/certification/guides/data-engineer-2/</a>
@Daniel Bourke Thank you so much for your time and info :) Much Love &lt;3
@sachin prabhu Use an Indian credit card from someone. It works. Debit cards don&#39;t support autodebit and are 3D secure which are not supported in American subscription payment gateways like Apple app store etc.
@Z3U5 Hey thanks for info. Shall check with credit card :)
@P G thank you 🌻☺️
Hey Daniel <br />Congratulations !!! &lt;3 <br /><br />Thanks for sharing your learning journey as always. I have been referring to Linux academy for couple of weeks, so I do agree with you its so much helpful. <br /><br />However I wanted to ask is Data Engineer exam more on theoretical aspect or were there questions regarding command line usage ? 
 <br /><br /><br />I had this issue with Google cloud platform since it doesn&#39;t accept Indian debit cards (Official statement - <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/3401127?hl=en)">https://support.google.com/a/answer/3401127?hl=en)</a><br /><br /> I couldn&#39;t practice anything practical at all on GCP since it doesn&#39;t allow to create any instances due to billing issue even with free credits on signup. <br /><br /><br />I have been just referring to reading material as of now including official documentation. <br />But at the end of day I am not able to use what I learned or practice on GCP and I do believe skills matter always.<br /><br /><br />It&#39;s always great to hear from you!
Every thing in life worth living for is hard to do.
It’s hard and challenging but that’s what I’m after. If it was easy I’d get bored.
Hey bro, is ML engineering that hard?
Thanks Abdurrahman!
Useful information, great video. Thanks!
😂 😂

It’s top quality! Thank you
I want to pass the exam just for that hoodie! Congrats!
Thanks Shubahm!
awesome Daniel . Congrats. Great strategy .
That’s Jimmy! My brothers bird 🐦
parrots in the background :D
Lmao
If it involves reading, the price is too high.
I think that the secret here ... Is your chair . XD
Crikey!
what saved the intro was your Aussie accent
Thanks Cornelius!
Thanks! This is very informative
👊 it’s comfy!
I subscribed the moment I saw that hoodie.
Hey Alberto! Thank you for the kind words :) and I didn’t even get to check out the Udemy course! Ooo that’s a good idea with the BigQuery and ML specialisations!<br /><br />And even better ideas for future videos! Model deployment is something I’m learning too. I’ll share more when I find out
@Daniel Bourke Now that you had exposure to both ML as well as Data engineering - you should do a follow up on which ones you liked better, pros and cons of each. I enjoy learning about ML better but found more demand in the job market for data engineers.. just my opinion
Hi Daniel... Good video and thank you for sharing. I&#39;m in the process of getting Google certified as well and have completed the Coursera certificate already. I must say I&#39;m finding the course from Udemy quite helpful (Loony Corn) as well as the Qwiklab practice labs. There&#39;s also other specializations on BigQuery as well as ML with Tensorflow that I&#39;m thinking of completing b4 the exam. BTW my suggestion would for future videos would be on deploying models in production with TF or ML engine.
You’re welcome! Thanks for watching!
Thank you sir
I’m a Machine Learning Engineer and content creator :)
@Daniel Bourke like for an organization/company?
@MicrosoftDude Machine Learning Engineer @ Max Kelsen, content creator @ DataCamp, A Cloud Guru, Coursera, YouTube and a few more
so what is your job? job title?
It’s 10/10 comfy! And Winter is coming in my hometown so perfect timing
That is very good hoodie
No, this is only a certification which represents my ability to use Google’s data engineering services?
Do you get a Google internship?
Hey Asif! I’d start diving into Python code and getting familiar with how to use it for different problems.<br /><br />A great resource is the book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. Otherwise, this article shows all the resources I used to get started as a machine learning engineer: <a href="http://bit.ly/AIMastersDegree">http://bit.ly/AIMastersDegree</a>
@Daniel Bourke starting up with python will be great idea ???
@Asif basically, learn the syntax and concepts of python. Then go to hackerrank and start their algorithms section. You&#39;ll start to use what you learn in Python. <br /><br />Technically, IT isn&#39;t only about coding. You&#39;ve got to learn how a computer works and how the OS works and what&#39;s happening under the hood when your code is being run.<br /><br />But, start off step by step. All the best 😊
@Anirudh thankyou
My age 21 im in commerce field im interested in IT field what things should i learn first n how should i create my career in IT field hope waiting for you reply

@SPOTBOY you get a voucher when you receive the certification email. You can choose between a timbuk2 backpack, hoodie or a jbl clip 3
😎
@Daniel Bourke from where did you got this hoddie??
Not fair, the hoodie adds +20 XP.
Hey Naveen! Doing any certificate is never a guarantee to get a job (but it can help). Best to check the requirements of the role and see if a certificate of this sort is something which could help your application!
@Daniel Bourke I really appreciate that man .
Can you work for Google, With the certification. Also your doing a good service for the community through the comments section. I really appreciate that man. Keep it up.☺️

The way you pronounce “data” bothers me
Thank you Victor! All the best with your studies/exam/future projects!
Thank you so much for your detailed video. It has been very important to me, thanks to it I’m now engaged on getting the same certification...

@Professor Xavier&#39;s Youtube account for the gifted Ah, I see. It did sound familiar :-) I didn&#39;t know that.
That cheesy 80&#39;s rap was pretty funny :-)
Some great feedback here! It’s hard to keep up to date with the constant changes but it’s also a good challenge. <br /><br />Thanks for the info!
Completely agree with you, Coursera also doesn&#39;t keep their courses up to date, most of the stuff in the exams also don&#39;t appear in the courses.
As a certified Google Cloud Architect I will say that the Coursera courses don&#39;t even come close to passing the certifications. They are a good start but I had work in GCP for a while to get a breadth of knowledge to use all the different features. Thanks for the video as I&#39;m just about to start working on my data engineer cert training.
Lol... Certificates help you shortlist your CV that&#39;s all.. Doesn&#39;t mean insecure
He’s right, certificates don’t necessarily mean competency. <br /><br />However, in our business, having Google Certifications allows us to partner closer with Google and for them to recommend our business to others.<br /><br />So while I agree with TechLead’s overall sentiment, there are some use cases where they’re useful.
Ex-Google TechLead says extra certificates just show that the person is probably insecure in their abilities. And he’s an ex google tech lead.
I don&#39;t have.
@Cloud Advocate okay thanks!
@Cloud Advocate hey I need your help?
Sure :)
Do you have any real question dumps?
All the best!
I will also giving this exam in next few month<br />But first i have to clear ocjp<br />I already cleared ocja today with 8.8 <br />Hope i will do that
the beginning was from The prinz of bel air 😂👍 i like this intro bro
🔜zoo
Thanks Tom!
Great video. Thanks for all the informatin.<br />Greetings from Munich, Tom.
Great video. Thanks for all the informatin.<br />Greetings from Munich, Tom.
Very useful for our business, it means Google recommends us to other businesses as being able to use their services.
How useful is it?
Thanks ChinWag!
Congratulations
You gotta love the Aussie accent. We love putting r’s where they shouldn’t be
Darrtaa certification lmfao everytime.
Wow, where is your humor at? Dont be a sour puss. 👋 more for us.

Why do people from India always say the &quot;bro&quot; thing 🤣😅
Thanks Robin! No, the practice tests are only accessible via signing up
Great video bro!! <br />Are the linux academy practice tests free?
Yo Gopesh! My desk is a normal office desk but it has a ‘varidesk’ attachment on it.<br /><br />With it you can turn any desk into a standing desk!
Hi Daniel,<br />Could you please tell me the brand and give details of desktop Table?<br />Thanks
You’re right! The Aussie accent loves to throw R’s into everything. I’m much more of a Python fan anyway 🐍
There is no R in data
It&#39;s helpful to know some gcloud commands or at least be able to distinguish a wrong command from a right command
@daniel How much programming language knowledge required for this certification and how many questions will be related to programming?
Great resource! Thank you!
I am also a Google Cloud Certified Data Engineer and have done both coursera courses and linux academy courses and there is also another alternative:<br /><a href="https://www.getgcpcertified.com/">https://www.getgcpcertified.com/</a><br />Also, the hoodie does give you street cred in the tech community! ;)
maths, systems, programming, tech
What are the skills needed to be a machine learning engineer???please make a video or blog
I know a site that trains you and gets you certified <a href="https://jvz1.com/c/1332453/304651">https://jvz1.com/c/1332453/304651
 </a><br />It only took me only a week
yea right? all those app are good for is saleing your information to second or third party for all the wrong reason .
TechLead is great!
you are subscribed to TechLead because it is TechLead
Thank you Ariel! Keep getting after it!
Thanks for the content legend. It’s good to see someone doing the same thing as me. Go hard
Glad you enjoyed Ashish!
Thanks for information...you r dope!
Thank you Akbar! Plenty more to come my friend! Keep getting after it.
You video opened a new world for me on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">https://www.coursera.org</a><br />Nice working man. Very very helpful resource you have provided. Keep sharing You experience. I know its had to do work, study &amp; plus share your working. You are the first man on youtube who has show the complete &amp; correct path for who wants to learn all this stuff. Otherwise people will just wondering here &amp; there. Thanks man.
They will all help but the field of data engineering is constantly changing as technology evolves. <br /><br />The main skill you’ll need to being able to research different tools and workout how to put them together.
@Daniel Bourke How much Stats and Math is used on the job as a data engineer? Also is CS background better or CIS when picking a major?
Is STATS and CS and CIS the best for data engineering ?
Get after it Eanam!
Thanks for your information ......I well definitely Try..
Thank you Ankit!
Nice and very detailed video. Good work.
A data engineer builds applications with data pipelines at the heart of them. From collecting data to manipulating data to using data to drive insight. A data engineer could be responsible for the whole pipeline or a single piece (in a team with other engineers). The cert alone is great but having a project/experience to back up the certificate is even better. You should always favour experience (such as, working on your own projects) over certifications.
@Daniel Bourke Thank you for this. Are you planning on entering the industry?
@Daniel Bourke Thank you so much for this reply. It helps a great deal. I am not a programmer yet, nor am I a coder but I am getting my cisco certs and am interested in the cloud cert.
@Daniel Bourke Even though I don&#39;t know what a pipeline is and all that stuff yet. I am trying to learn some basics.
Can you tell us, what can you do as a Data Engineer? Can you get hired with that cert alone ? And if so, what would you be doing? Thanks
hiii sir i was completed 5 COURSE SPECIALIZATION
 <br />Architecting with Google Compute Engine after that what can i do for the examination sir plz send me email

Thank you Sandeep! As for the exam, there weren’t any programming questions on mine, all multi-choice.
That being said, there were some which were code multi choice, e.g. pick the right command to type into the GCP console
@Daniel Bourke Thanks for replying Daniel. What among these programming languages is the best to learn to be successful as a GCP data engineer?<br />1)Java<br />2) Python<br />3) Go
@Sundeep Kumar L All are usable but I chose Python, I found it the most accessible!
Hey Dan, thanks a lot for putting things together. Really useful!!<br /><br /><br />Will there be any programming questions in the GCP Data Engg exam? Pls answer this!
Bloopers were best!🔥
I am a data scientist coming from the algorithmic side. I used to have a subscription at <a href="http://datacamp.com/">datacamp.com</a> and I am considering a subscription at linux academy to get more experience with data engineering and cloud services. I am not so much interested in certificates, cause I habe some project records already. Can you recommend it to me?
Thank you Richard! Any hands-on experience you can get is the best experience
The video is awesome. May I know if you recommend doing hands-on lab from Qwiklabs besides material and exam questions preparation ?
I usually wear a medium!
Hey Daniel Bourke, may I know the size of the hoodie that you are wearing?
did you had any previous experience or knowledge in this field?<br />I studied Finance, but now wanna pursue data science, so just wondering whether someone like me could learn it online on my own?
Congratulations, DIPAYAN MUKHOPADHYAY! Lots of success in the future!
@Dulguun Bolor you can learn it but it will take some time
Comgtatsss
Woww
Amazing effort Dipayan! Congratulations!
Dulguun Bolar this certification is mostly towards learning GCP data science/engineering products such as Bigquery,BigTable,DataFlow,AI Platform etc.. For Data Science I would suggest go for coursera Andrew Ng Machine Learning course first.
This video was really helpful.. Did exactly what you&#39;ve suggested... Today wrote the exam.. Passed.. 🙂🙂
Personnaly i can use Google Chrome and i&#39;m still searching a job
Great video! Good detail and tips. Very informative. Thank you for sharing. Keep up the good work!
Congratulations Kenny!
I just pass the GCP Data Engineer certification and this video was my first motivation to study and start preparing for the exam. Thank you for sharing this!!!
Check out the resources I put in the description. When you first start, it’ll be hard but with practice, you’ll get better.<br /><br />Everyone starts with 0 experience (including me).
Do you have any advice for someone who wants to get cloud certified with zero experience?
SUDHIR YADAV you’d be better off starting with the Assoc. Cloud Engineer if you don’t have a lot of experience.
Google cloud platform professional certificate is needed with 3 year of experience in indrudtry is it so???? because i am a colledge student so can i apply for google cloud professional cdrtification
Thank you Rozy! It’s a deep rabbit hole indeed! 🕳 <br /><br />I’m deep in it too!
Mate I&#39;ve just started down the ML/AI rabbit hole. Currently working to learn this whole new field as I am a nurse by day but with a huge love of data + technology and can see the huge potential to integrate ML in health care. Need to start from basics though.....<br />Point being - came across your channel, happy, subscribed. Nice to find an Aussie channel interested in these things. <br />Thanks for the video.
It was the one I chose/the platform we used most often at work. Both are great though.
Why GCP and why not AWS ?
It was the one we used at work/the one I had more experience with!
Great review! Why have you chosen Google Cloud and not AWS certification? I might be missing something, but AWS is more popular than Google Cloud.
Do you need a bachelors?
Very helpful Daniel. Thank you for posting this!
Good stuff!
I’d go for whichever one you’re most interested in! I had no experience in cloud prior to learning either
@Daniel Bourke Okay.. Thanks man
Hey Daniel !! Should I consider to take Google Cloud Engineer exam first before jump into Data Engineer? Since I don&#39;t have any prior knowledge on cloud
Can a complete fresher to cloud with mainframe experience switch the career doing this certificate.
Hey Paul! The course is very project orientated, however when I did it wasn’t exactly with the actual GCP platform, more a pseudo-version of it. So in terms of having a portfolio after, this may hard. However, things might have changed since I did it!
Hey Daniel, just curious about the Coursera course, does each section of the specialization contain project related to GCP , I am looking to eventually get certified, but out would be nice to be able to add some use-cases/projects to my portfolio along the way. Thanks in advance.
No worries at all! All the best with it!
Thanks dude.
Thank you Sidharth!
Hahahah Messed up with the title each time!!<br />Good job explaining everything, thumbs up!
How much of programming does this course/field require?
Hey Victoria! <br /><br />Any kind of cloud certification will likely help with the eventual building of machine learning systems. I’m not too familiar with AWS certifications but I do know many companies use AWS as their cloud infrastructure. <br /><br />I’d look into seeing if there are any AWS machine learning specific certifications you can get, may be more tailored to what you’re after
Hey Daniel.<br /><br />Would you recommend an AWS Cloud Solutions Architect certification for someone who wants to be a machine learning engineer?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bedzsHNSKnA&amp;t=11m09s">11:09</a> You know you are a systems guy when you Freudian slip &quot;CRON&quot; into a sentence.
Instead of saying &quot;to make a long story shorter&quot;. I would prefer you to say &quot; to make a long story even longer&quot;. I believe that would be a better way of going!!!!!!!!!!!
thank you very much for sharing your tips with us! :) it was useful for the exam. I also used this udemy course and got really similar questions in the exam: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/google-cloud-associate-engineer-exam-practice-tests/?couponCode=READYTOPASS2020">https://www.udemy.com/course/google-cloud-associate-engineer-exam-practice-tests/?couponCode=READYTOPASS2020</a>

You&#39;re welcome wing wing!
Thanks a lot!
Yes, with adequate preparation
Hi Daniel. I am presently a grad student and I dont have any experience . I am thinking to take this exam. Is it possible to crack this certification ?
Wow. That&#39;s a super compliment. Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.
Man, there is some seamless combination of your energy, attention to softer skills like writing and skilfully communication, and deep immersion into the most advanced tech on earth today that has me feeling super inspired. <br /><br />I&#39;m a big fan. I was trying to do all this a couple of years ago, but life got in the way. A few weeks into diving back in. All your stuff is super helpful.
Im a telecom technician working at a data center right now in montreal and i was wondering if i could jump from doing everyday data center operations work to data engineering with my experience and this certification under my belt<br />Can anybody let me know if its a little out of my &#39;&#39;skillset&#39;&#39;? lol, and if so what should i do to get there - if thats the case?<br /><br />watching this as im on my night shift, just really tired of cabling servers, i want more of a challenge
There was a time when you can use Google services for free. Now when Google becomes a giant, everything is no longer free, unless if you activate your trial version.
Google Data Engineer Certified? Oh Dan, you are a rockstar!!
Gold !! ^_^
Hey Martin, thank you for watching. Just a question, how does one become a ‘real’ YouTube expert? I’m always looking to improve and would love your help.
Daniel Bourke get some real experience instead all the bs certs you have, moron
just another fake youtube expert
I got you - <a href="https://youtu.be/ya5NwvKafDk">https://youtu.be/ya5NwvKafDk</a>
Can you please make a video on the TF developer certification you did in 2020..
Thanks for the information. I will go through the mentioned resources to get certification. :)
I loved the Fresh Prince reference! LOL!!....you have my attention, sir.
No you don’t need a degree, just a willingness to learn and acquire the skills you need
Do I need a degree for google cloud data engineering jobs?
Thank you dude. I&#39;m from Costa Rica, I would be so happy to invite you as a speaker in some of our meetups.
Some ML/DS knowledge is good to have for the data engineer exam (at least when I did it), however, it may have changed. I’d checkout the GCP data engineering page and see what they say the curriculum is.
@Daniel Bourke thank you so much. That would be so great.. you are a gem
Do I need to be well versed with Data science to get certified in GCP data engineering? As I am working on data warehousing and ETL, wondering if I need to lear ML first and then go for GCP<br /><br />Do we have to complete GCP cloud Engineer exam?
Hello. Sir im a average student but in lockdown i got free coursera access and applied for courses like aws, Google (data Engineer,cloud engineering and cloud architecture) dont know much about them but they are in professional certificate column so try to get info about them and find interesting<br />PlZ guide me should I start learning or do something in advance before starting these courses or anything u suggest me thats adds upto my knowledge or helps me

Anyone here know what *.google Certificate is ? is it used by Android Dev ???
Yo Dois! That’s so amazing! So stocked to hear my friend. Congratulations
did you receive any redeem code for the hoodie???
@ritwik sharma hey, not yet. I contacted google and they said they are having diffiulties due to the pandemic, but are trying to solve everything as fast as posible.
@Dois ducados ok thanks , i too passed and didn&#39;t received any code so just wanted to check
Hey Daniel, thanks for this video! Just passed the exam today with almost no google cloud experience (and a year as a Data Science intern). Your blog post was my main guide and helped a lot :)
What&#39;s the exact difference between a Machine Learning Engineer and a Data Scientist?
Hey Daniel, I&#39;m going to take this exam head on. I have no work experience at all in building pipelines or architectures. I have completed deep learning nanodegree and <a href="http://deeplearning.ai/">deeplearning.ai</a> specialization. Going to follow your blog and steps. Do you think I can make it without a little bit of work experience ?<br />Your answer would motivate me to grind on it till I get it
I have no prior IT experience, formerly an Art Director/Graphic Designer, but as I begin my transition from that to Web Development, I was approached with the idea that Cloud systems was a better way to go. <br /><br />Without any prior experience or knowledge, where should I begin or what should I at least need to know before trying to attempt a GCP Certification?
Also what other resources or things would you suggest I need to know. Thank you in advance!
Really depends where you&#39;d like to go, I have no computer science or programming background either (I learned all of these things after graduating).<br /><br />As for this path, it depends on where you want to go.<br /><br />If you want to get into some kind of data engineering role, this would be a prime place to start looking at what it might take.<br /><br />If you&#39;re interested in seeing how I learned, you can check out my AI Masters Degree (I made this up when I wanted to get into machine learning) - <a href="https://dbourke.link/aimastersdegree">https://dbourke.link/aimastersdegree</a>
@Daniel Bourke Thanks! Anything to get going in a direction helps. Great video btw!
Hey Daniel or people in the know,<br /><br />I was recently approached by a friend in the Computer Science/IT industry, and he was mentioning to me of the opportunities of Cloud Certifications, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, so I took s9me time to look into it. Unfortunately, I didn’t go to school for Computer Science or anything Programming related, I have a Bachelors in Marketing w/ a minor in Graphic Design. <br /><br />But I’m very much into technology and have been learning programming languages, and have decided that a career change may be in the works due to the over-saturation of applicants in the Advertising/Marketing scene. <br /><br />Do you recommend this as a path for myself? How possible or impossible is it for a non-Computer Science person like myself to find success in this field? Basically, is it worth it for a person with absolutely no experience to head into this industry?
Hahahaha this made me smile
I LOVED the rap!!!
How to get job in Google company
nice demo. nice teacher. Those who complain, is a free explanation video. If you don&#39;t understand, walk and pay for a course.
Hey Diver! Congratulations on passing. I’m not sure about the architect exam, I’ve only done the professional data engineer one.
hi Daniel, i gave an exam too. the associate engineer exam. the story was much similar. even i made a video i was so excited of having pass. So im considering trying the Architect certification. I want to ask you if you know its much more difficult? the associate exam was hard enough - it was not smth easy. thanks
Excellent Daniel im going to try your path
The exam might’ve changed a little bit since I’ve done it, so I’d do your research and see if the Google Data Engineering Certification page still aligns with the Linux Academy practice exam
hi man, you said to do the linuxacademy final exam ... first i tried to get 70%, i guess now i can do 100% memory ... i say this because you said you used it to practice. I don&#39;t know whether to continue studying or just take the exam. Everything is so long. Thank you
i cleared gcp associate cloud engineer bit didn&#39;t got the mug.. anything I&#39;m missing??
i cleared gcp associate cloud engineer but didn&#39;t get any reedeem code..
Is the acloud guru gcp-101 course free? The website is asking me to become an annual member. The video links aren&#39;t opening without signing up for membership. Can you clarify?
I love that you went through the most basic questions first. Very helpful.
Hi,<br /> One of the courses I was doing on coursera was showing the differences between google cloud and AWS. Does the exam ask you difference between the two?
Take as long as you need, I’d say one month minimum (with relevant experience)
How long does it take to prepare for the data engineer certifications exam.
I went straight to professional
Daniel Bourke thanks
Do you have to pass associate certification before getting professional one? I know it will be useful but is it mandatory?
It could be, this is more targeted to data engineering. It depends on what you need to do with data analytics
@Daniel Bourke I want to get into using Python for Data Analytics.
@Aditya Pawar you might want to look at some data analytic specific resources (plenty on DataCamp and DataQuest) - this is more targeted to data engineering
@Daniel Bourke Okay Daniel. Thanks for the prompt reply and make such awesome videos. Will do the courses you mentioned. <br /><br />Keep on posting such videos. 👍🏻
Hey Daniel, <br /><br />Thanks for the video. It was an informative one!!!!<br /><br />Just had a doubt. I want to get into Data Analytics. So will this course be appropriate and beneficial for me?
I ashume you are knowledgebleeeeeeeeeeeee<br />]
where did you get the hoodie tho?
most likely exam dumps...
For a google cloud engineer certificate yet using all these pricey 🍎 devices I see in the video 😉 oh the irony!
When I did the practice exam was similar to the actual exam, however, it might’ve changed over the past ~18-months
Hello Daniel, thanks for the video. Do questions from practice tests often show up in the main exam?
Should we do all certificatation to become cloud computing.please replay
What if I&#39;m just a guy who isn&#39;t a data engineer and just wants to get the certification to up his money ??
Woah! Thank you for letting me know, so cool to hear you passed! Massive effort my friend!
Hey Mate, just want to say a quick thank you ! This video inspired me set a date and take up and pass the certification. The details you outlined were very helpful and definitely helped me plan better for the exam.
Enjoy Sebastian!
This is exactly what I was looking for! Thanks mate!
Totally coincidental
How is the market down under? I intend to go back there in a data science skilled visa
Hahaha what a good coincidence! The market in Aus is growing, more and more companies are coming on board. Even then, remote options are growing too.
Congratulation brother, I have seen your videos and got interested in ML. Bought a course in Udemy, guess who is my teacher. Have a nice one mate!
Heya, I think that may be out of my wheel house. There are optimization algorithms used in machine learning to deal with gradient descent (how a model learns) but unless that’s what you’re talking about we may be thinking different things. Are you talking about optimising predictions? Or something like optimising a process? Like the directions between two points on a map?
This might be of interest to you: <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/traffic-prediction-with-advanced-graph-neural-networks">https://deepmind.com/blog/article/traffic-prediction-with-advanced-graph-neural-networks</a>
@Daniel Bourke The optimization I&#39;m talking about is like what you said, best route between two points with an objective, like best route using minimum fuel or minimum time. <br />Differs from ML because in ML the objective is modeling a precise prediction, optimization is about trimming a problem to a mathematical basis to find the optimal solution.<br /><br />Recently I found a ML approach to optimization in pricing, they train a model to predict sales and experiment different prices in the test data to compare which prices produces the best profit overtime. <br /><br />After asking to you I did some search in udemy and found a nice course on the subject: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/optimization-with-metaheuristics/">https://www.udemy.com/course/optimization-with-metaheuristics/</a><br /><br />I asked because I thought it was interesting knowledge to use in data science, and I&#39;ve seen few approaches using it. <br />Thank you
@Daniel Bourke Yes, precisely, very interesting material. They are using MetaGradients to optimize the learning rate, MetaGradient is a optimization technique. Well, I see a lot of ground to explore in ML using optimization techniques to tweak its effectivity.
@Rodrigo Soares so cool! Google just released a paper on building optimizers to optimize themselves: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11243">https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11243</a> - you might be interested
Hey, mate<br />let me ask you a thing, my undergrads was on applied maths and operations research, it means that what I learned was more focused on the optimization field. <br />Now studying ML and Data Science, I see a lot of prediction and no optimization, can you reference me material related to optimization in data science?<br />best regards!

I&#39;ve just passed the Google ACE exam. Thank you so much for sharing great content. I spent a month for the exam with resources on Udemy. For study I chose acloud guru and awslagi for exam dumps. You can search awslagi on udemy. They are providing good exam dumps.Resources for references are youtube videos and hand on labs. That&#39;s all for my preparation.
ML requires data
Your r a ml engineer but why did u go for data engineer certificate
Linux academy was bought by A Cloud Guru, they are one company now
Trying to access linuxacademy website I&#39;m redirected to A Cloud Guru. Is linuxacademy down for good?
Does this apply for the google cloud architect certification as well ?
When I did it there was a multi-choice exam, you needed to get about 80% correct
@Daniel Bourke number of questions?
What&#39;s the passing criteria for this in order to get certified?
Doesn&#39;t matter. Pick any.
which cloud provider should i start with? aws or google? thank you
where do i start in google cloud as absolute beginner?? left IT world long time ago and now thinking of getting back to it lol i got ccna from 10+ years ago and thats about it..

I just passed my GCP Data engineering certification. Could you tell if google really takes 7-10 business days to verify/send the license key? or they often reply earlier than that?<br />Thanks in Advance!
amazing &lt;3
What is the difference between the certification we get after doing gcp course from udemy nd by giving the exam ?
Can you please make a video on is data engineering a good career for future.
Do people really hire people with just only this certification, if so how much is the average wage?
Massive effort Syed! Congratulations my friend!
This video was really helpful - I passed the exam !
Yes, it’ll still help for the 2021 exam, I’d be sure to check the criteria though (on Google’s website) to make sure the skills line up. Also Linux Academy is now a part of A Cloud Guru so all of the courses you’ll need will be on A Cloud Guru.
congrats ! i learn a lot in this video thanks and is this video still relevant to 2021 exam ?
Whichever you prefer, I chose Google Cloud because it was what my company used at the time, and I’ve stuck with it
Hey Should I go for AWS Big Data or Google Cloud Data Engineering Certification?
No you can go straight to professional
@Daniel Bourke thank you :)
I have question that do i have to pass Associate Cloud Engineer certification before data engineer certification ?? Because based on GCP website, they said&quot;Associate Cloud Engineer certification is a good starting point for those new to cloud and can be used as a path to professional level certifications.&quot; so.. i&#39;m confusing... anyone knows ???
Search data engineer in coursera
Do you have any idea about how to clear Professional Data engineer exam
Hi Daniel, I did not find the course &#39;Data Engineering on Google Platform Specialization&#39; . Has the course been changed. Could you please provide the link of this course on Coursera
One of the main ones is Full-Stack Deep Learning
@Daniel Bourke thank you for responded back to me. If I were to take this course cause I&#39;m currently on Google I.T. certification course will I still be able to get a job with all these certifications I&#39;m curious to know? Or if is the goal to be your own boss and have the skills to make a business out of it? Or would I need to get my certifications in these courses then take a course for a degree? And how many other courses are you taking? Sorry for so many questions just trying to figure out and get some feedback and see how I can make this work for me.
No course guarantees a job. When I went through this course, it was for the job I was working at. <br /><br />My best advice on getting a job is here: <a href="https://www.mrdbourke.com/how-can-a-beginner-data-scientist-like-me-gain-experience/">https://www.mrdbourke.com/how-can-a-beginner-data-scientist-like-me-gain-experience/</a>
What courses did you take after this program?
Hi Albert Congratss !! Did you start as newbie or you had any prev experience ? I wanna pursue my career in data engineering.Have a begineer level knowledge in Data Engineering.Would Pluarlsight and practise exam would be suffice ? Any suggestions or advice would be really helpful
Great video as usual. I cleared the exam this morning.. Exam tips and resources i used.
 <br />I followed course from Pluralsight, which pretty much covers everything for data engineer exam.
 <br />I additionally used Skillcertpro exam questions for practice. They have around 541 questions. Evaluate yourself by scoring above 85% in these tests before attempting real exam. Most of these questions are very identical to real exam, which helped me to score higher in my main exam,
 <br />All questions comes with detailed explanation at the end. Review them. retake tests multiple times if you&#39;re scoring below 85%. because practicing exam questions is key for passing the real exam. 
 <br />I hope this helps anyone who is planning for certification.
 <br />Feel free to ask any more questions regarding this. Happy to help
Did you post your certification anywhere online like LinkedIn?
Make a 2021 version of his video

What is the difference between Machine Learning Engineer and Data Engineer and Data Scientist
Daniel Bourke yes definitely it’s hard to decide a career path and these are often confused
Yo Daniel what&#39;s the age limit in order to study cloud
Do you have a CS Degree back in the day? Before you started to choose to be a professional Data Engineer.
How much does a data engineer earn?
Is there more than one color for the Google cloud hoodie?
Thanks for the suggestion, its been really2 helpful to me .
Will AI replace your jobs?
A trick: you can watch series at Flixzone. Been using them for watching all kinds of movies lately.
@Asher Maximo Yea, been watching on Flixzone for since november myself :D
Dear Sri Muruga, you can take AWS Solutions Architect course which covers the AWS Certified Solutions Architect exam. The entire Intellipaat course is in line with AWS certification curriculum which helps you get the best jobs in top MNCs.<br />You can check Intellipaat aws course details here: <a href="https://intellipaat.com/aws-certification-training-online/#course-content">https://intellipaat.com/aws-certification-training-online/#course-content</a>
Hi, need a suggestion from you guys. Currently I am working in Oracle production support now looking for change my domain to Aws. which aws course is better to proceed further to my Career..
Hi Ambesh, our GCP online training course is of 24 hours when you are a complete beginners but if you have experience in AWS, you can master in less than that. Here&#39;s our course link: <a href="https://intellipaat.com/google-cloud-certification-architect-training/">https://intellipaat.com/google-cloud-certification-architect-training/</a>
If you have a Google account try now itself it just matter of 1 rupee payment
how much time will it take to learn GCP if i am working on AWS for 2 years?
Hi Saikat, If you are looking at a cheaper price then i would recommend you to go with gcp and if you are looking for more reliability and features then aws is the service you want to move in to.
@Intellipaat yeah seems like gcp is cheaper but question is how much cheaper??<br />Does saved extra dollars Worth it ?<br />Dual core 8 GB ram configuration I am looking for .
@Saikat Chanda GCP has better flexibility in pricing (pay how long u use)
Payment gateways are secure in azzure
Hi I have normal payment gateway application in Java installed in azure . I want to move out from Microsoft . Which one to choose between aws or gcp ?
Thanks and love from the other side of the world. :) Keep learning and upskilling with us.
(y) best regards from México. Manuel Silva
That&#39;s true puneet. :)
we can connect aws ec2 even its &quot;Status check&quot; is Initializing because by default aws cloud watch collect metric in 5 min time .<br />As soon as instance become in running state we will be able to connect .if we run # init 0 in GCP ,it take longer time to detect detect instance state but AWS detect faster .No doubt GCP spin-up VM faster than AWS but &quot;Instance state&quot; and &quot; Status check &quot; are completely different.
my thought excatly
how does gcp handle the auth into instance without a keypair?
@jia chen It uses ssh from a web shell. It&#39;s works pretty magically. Also you get free cloud shell, free Kubernetes master in GCP which you can&#39;t in AWS.
Do you think launch time of instance shows the speed of the web services?
Thanks Alan. Keep learning with Intellipaat.:)
love your enthusiasm man you woke me up !
Noted!
Good video, the only thing to work on is your accent, which was a quite hard to understand
Good video, i hate your accent though
Glad you liked it. Keep learning with Intellipaat. :)
Good video
cool. :)
I would recommend AWS which is why I am using AWS from Cloudways platform so that I don&#39;t have to invest time in server management responsibilities.
Depends how well you learn. Since you have experience you definitely will get that package.
I am currently working as Research Analyst in an mnc with 4+ yrs of total experience (2 yrs as a research analyst). I&#39;m from an IT background and wanna pursue Cloud. Can I get a 6lacs plus package after completing AWS Solution Architect Certification?
both will be fine.
@Intellipaat thanks ji . Do u develop app
Bro, i m also developing online learning service. Did u find out anything, about which one is better?
Dear i want to launch educational app - videos - which server will be the best
boomer
okay
I would like to add a couple of points<br /><br />1. AWS has freaking extensive documentation for every service<br />2. The aws-cli is much more easy to work with than gcloud cli IMO
Sure . Noted. Will upload soon. :)
😄😊 thanks bhai, viewer ki bate sunne ke liye
Bhai hindi me bhi video banao
@Intellipaat which fast??
Google is catching AWS fast.
Indian tends to like Google, as simple as that
Whats the differences in the services they provide? It would be good to know the name of services that are unique to each platform.
how did you did the animations?
thanks!
I&#39;ll use AWS any day. Even my personal use of google products such as Google Domains sucks ass, and my account frequently terminated without me using them, but already paid. GCP has so many issues and downtimes since even the early 2020. And based on my junior devops, his previous company has a contact in tens millions of dollars in GCP but they&#39;ve so many issues, and forcing them to have redundancy instances, causing costs to rise. Even while typing this on youtube I&#39;ve to search how to logout my other stupid google account. The only product that they&#39;ve made so good and stable is their search.
If business is small with limited budget, then go for GCP
Depends on the business.
Is gcs a better for statrtup?
Its very urgent can i get your contact no or email<br />I need to clearify something&#39;s 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

I would like to start a WordPress site where I can blog and sell digital products. Which platform should I choose AWS or GCP? I have no coding background.
Good explanation sir.i am beginner so i want to ask that which is better for me to learn????
Im not telling you what to do. But amazons UI looks like like bill gates, and googles UI looks like Steve Jobs. I think it depends on what kinda business you wanna run.
building ecommerce wordpress site and thinking which of AWS or GCP to host with, can someone advise, please? thanks
Very well explain .But please suggest me which one should I use for Stocks and Forex Trading .
not sure if anyone cares at all but I just hacked my gfs Instagram password using Instapwn. Just google for it ;)

Hey Obaidur, You can move your instances between zones, by taking a snapshot of your persistent disks, using the snapshots to launch new instances in the desired zone, and deleting your original resources. If a zone is deprecated, you can use this method to move your instances from the deprecated zone.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

Hey Naveen, Datastore is technology that can store data in relation form(tables, columns, fields..).Datastore can be very broad terminology. It can be a technology that can store both structured or unstructured data.<br /><br />Hope this helps!
Please correct me if i am wrong. But i was under the impression that Datastore stores structured data that is non relational and that all data (that can be stored in any database ), is structured data. all of your files (mp3, documents etc etc) are unstructured data. your thoughts please.

@storagefreak Hey man, can you make an tutorial or just tell me how I can get an Windows 10 image or how I can use the free windows 10 and not actually buy a license. It would be very helpful if you could help me and other people that have the same issue. Also, if you would make a tutorial i think you will help lots of people, as there`s no such tutorials out there...
Hi Julian! Really good question. Currently available OS images in Google Cloud Compute Engine focuses mostly on &#39;Windows Server&#39; editions. So, from the Windows family you can choose from Windows Server 2008, 2012, 2016, 2019 and so on.<br />You can Import Your own Windows 10 image, and take advantage of &#39;Bring your own license&#39; feature! Read more about it here:<br /><a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/windows/">https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/windows/</a><br /><br />I&#39;m not sure what you would like to achieve, but there is a good chance, whatever workload You wish to run on Windows 10, you can most likely run it on &#39;Windows Server&#39; edition as well.
What if I want a windows 10 vm instead of a windows server vm, how can I achive this?
@storagefreak I don&#39;t believe its free anymore for windows. Go check it out. Doesn&#39;t let you make windows.
Adooma if you select ‘upgrade ‘ from bill menus,then create it again ,you will find everything is free.
@storagefreak its not free anymore, it says this on the website &quot;You can&#39;t create VM instances that are based on Windows Server images&quot;
Hi, you have to add a billing account, however you can still take advantage of 300 USD welcome bonus and make sure the account stays as &#39;free&#39;. Check out this video <a href="https://youtu.be/W5mPX1-015o">https://youtu.be/W5mPX1-015o</a> or go to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/">https://cloud.google.com/free/</a> for official info and details :)
@Matthew Pang Thanks for pointing that out! Unfortunately the policy changed...
Can you still do this on new accounts? Mine says that it cannot launch windows vm on the free trial account and that I need to add a billing address
Of course you can :) you are THE administrator of your Windows VM, you can definitely decide what applications run on it.
Can you download windows&#39; program n run it? I would like to run a bioinformatics related program (windows compatible) 24/7.
It seems you do not have billing account attached. Check out this video it should help<br /><a href="https://youtu.be/W5mPX1-015o">https://youtu.be/W5mPX1-015o</a>
I am getting a message tht TO USE COMPUTER ENGINE WITH THIS PROJECT,CONTACT A PROJECT OWNER TO ENABLE BILLING...plss help me out with this..i am not getting a option to create vm instances😭
Good stuff. Thanks for posting this video.
If you have and want to use your own licenses check out this article for more details <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/windows/bring-your-own-license/">https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/windows/bring-your-own-license/</a><br /><br />When you provision the Windows VM by default you do not purchase the license, rather pay for time while your instance is running. For more details check out this article <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/windows/">https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/windows/</a>
Do you know if the windows licence belongs to the user? Or once the service is gone or discontinued we are reimbursed? Also, can I connect to the VM using windows remote desktop?
Hi Philip, you can turn on and off your VMs in the Google Cloud console, once it&#39;s turn on you can shutdown your laptop/computer and it will not affect the state of your VM. Remember when you want to disconnect from the remote desktop session, use &#39;logout&#39; instead of &#39;shutdown&#39; to keep the VM running :)
@storagefreak Okay awesome! You helped out a ton with this video. And thanks for the super fast reply!
Does the windows computer you&#39;re running the remote desktop connetion from have to be turned on for the VM to be able to run 24/7? Or do you just have to connect it once and once the VM is turned on you can turn off the remote desktop connected pc?
skiROCKET MUSIC first you must delete system32 on real pc
Yes.
@skiROCKET MUSIC sorry, I didn&#39;t get a notification. As long as you don&#39;t run memz on your pc, it&#39;ll be fine.
@Zachowns10 please don&#39;t troll.
Dylan Harding so, just to confirm if I just go setup Can you please call me? and run like memz, mr real pc would be fine???
I don’t know why I said call me and it’s okay
Dylan Harding it’s fine and I don’t know why i said call me
Zachowns10 don’t try to scam me I’m not dumb
Zachowns10 Dude, I know what I does, even if a tried UAC shield would block it
Wait, if you ran a virus, it would be okay?
how do you set the gpu
Of course! You can restart it as much as you want. You can also shut it down and keep it down for weeks if you wish. And you will only be charged by storage used while the machine is not running.
Is there a way to restart the vm without deleting data?
oof tfw 90% of it is just &#39;waiting&#39; on windows
yes you can you can also chk : <a href="https://youtu.be/ja9HenlU9ho">https://youtu.be/ja9HenlU9ho</a>

it can do better <br />it can run crysis in crysis in doom
BUT CAN IT RUN CRYSIS
i wonder if they just changed that, running into the same problem
@Ryan Kane Its a new thing. sadly you cannon do it for free anymore :(
you have to enable billing to have the windows available to use but you can still use your free credits. just make sure you cancel billing before your free credits run out
@lilcrazyj0sh how do you enable billing
Sorry mate, they must have changed that. I&#39;ve found information here:<br /><a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier">https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier</a><br />Indeed currently with free tier you cannot create Windows VMs :(<br />@Bosnian to enable billing you can click the icon on the top bar with a &quot;gift&quot; symbol :)
Unable to create windows VM instance with free trial
That was really useful and clear
The credentials never work, eve after resetting the password, before RDP connections. Google cloud VM instances never accept the credentials through RDP. Just does NOT work.
可惜现在免费订阅不能安装Windows了
how do i stall any software for example if i wish to intall tableau should i go into the windows server remotely and intall it there ? please advice
Sure you can stop them for however long you wish. Just remember: You will still be billed for storage used for the VM, and if you haven&#39;t reserved IP address, when you restart your VM there it will most likely get different IP.
Can I stop this cm instances if I stop working on for a week
If you click on details below the monthly estimate, you can see that it&#39;s a monthly fee that you pay for the windows license.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5wl1s5gKY0&amp;t=1m09s">1:09</a> License cost of Windows server OS is one time or monthly?

No, unfortunately no. You can check pricing here: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/vm-instance-pricing">https://cloud.google.com/compute/vm-instance-pricing</a>.<br />If you&#39;ve got credits on your account you can utilize those :) but currently you first have to &#39;upgrade&#39; from free-tier account to standard one to be able to provision Windows Based VM.
Is that free or not ??
Hi, please check out this resource: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/vm-instance-pricing">https://cloud.google.com/compute/vm-instance-pricing</a><br /><br />I don&#39;t want to get into details for pricing in the comment section, because it might get updated in the future, it&#39;s always best to look for official google cloud docs.
Could you please explain the pricing method for VM? We need to pay by hours the instance is being turned on? or it only counts when the instance is performing some sort of calculation?<br />And how much is a monthly rent? It would be nice if we have an always on Virtual Machine?
easy bro
Sorry mate, they must have changed that. I&#39;ve found information here:<br /><a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier">https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier</a><br />Indeed currently with free tier you cannot create Windows VMs :(
hi Storagefreak, .. i have created a free account on GCP .. but while creating the Windows VM .. i am getting this error .. &quot;&quot;&quot;Windows VM instances are not included with the free trial. To use them, first enable billing on your account. You&#39;ll still be able to apply your free trial credits to eligible products and services&quot;&quot; .. has they stopped Window VM for free account or i am missing something .. i just followed the steps as per your video... video is just 7 months old !!!

Why use Windows Datacenter version?
how do i install or download any application inside it
Thank you really for Help it helped me so much
It sounds like you&#39;ve selected Windows Server [...] Core edition, which has a smaller footprint, but doesn&#39;t have a full experience of Graphical Interface, rather command line ;)<br />Try to select a different Image.
@storagefreak Thanks, will look at that
my vm is black.. why is that?
@Stefano Monteiro Beta version of what ?
It is impossible. The Actual PC ( VM ) very far away from you. Even you cannot connect your wifi. They&#39;ll give the machine with an Ethernet Internet.
Installed beta version and it worked!
@Taha Reddahi Microsoft Remote Desktop :)

It seems that Bluetooth is not available in the VM. How can I connect a ps3 controller to play some games?
Dzieki za video bardzo pomocne
Straight to the point video, I&#39;ve been looking for almost 3 to 4 days and try to understand and use VM beside gsuite CLI

Hi, sorry I&#39;m not doing any 1-on-1 consultations, but leave the question in the comment section, perhaps me or someone else from the community will be able to help :)
Hello bro..i need some help can u please spare a minute for me?
Thanks man! Well, once you logoff from your VM, it will still be up-and-running :) even if you power down your home pc.<br />But consider other options, running Windows VM 24/7 just to run some python program might be expensive. Perhaps consider using Google Cloud Functions? (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions)">https://cloud.google.com/functions)</a><br />or Google Cloud Run? (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/)">https://cloud.google.com/run/)</a>
@storagefreak I&#39;m using the free tier btw it didn&#39;t work I don&#39;t why both crome and gecko driver doesn&#39;t run on the windows free vm?u know anything about this?
I&#39;m on AWS windows VM
Hi bro, did you make it work?
bro nice video,im trying to run a web automation python program ,i want to host it on the cloud and it should run on its own at certain times,now i want to keep my home pc off,how do i go about it?
Hi Darmin, you are charged in a nutshell by every hour (if I remember correctly - every second to be precise) that the VM is powered on. Check out this article with details <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/all-pricing">https://cloud.google.com/compute/all-pricing</a>
wait, im confused. are we being charged by the hour or usage? because i know digitalocean charges you by the usage...so i can use it as much as i want and pay the same price every month?
Hi Ed, you need &#39;allow http and/or https traffic&#39; only if you want to have port 80(http) and/or port 443(https) opened on Google cloud firewall between your VM and &#39;world&#39;. In other words if you don&#39;t plan to use your VM as a web server there is no need to do it :)<br />Check out my other video about Google cloud firewall rules, I explain that a bit more :)
I noticed that you didn&#39;t click on &quot;Allow http &amp; https traffic&quot; in the section that reads Firewall. Is that because you are using a Microsoft computer already? Or is that because it&#39;s somehow unnecessary? Thanks for the video - short &amp; sweet!
Hi Phat, I don&#39;t think so, but you can check the official docs to validate it :) <br /><a href="http://cloud.google.com/docs/">cloud.google.com/docs/</a>
Hi suppose i am logging into the cloud VM as a fat client - does Google have a cheaper plan where all/most processing power/resources like CPU cores/RAM is provided by the fat client?
There’s something you can download called xfreerdp. Good lick
How can you turn shielded VM?
Unfortunately I cannot test it myself, but look for &quot;microsoft remote desktop&quot; in the App Store.<br />The link I&#39;ve found, hope it helps: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12</a>

Hey César. Aren&#39;t you the winner for the 1besttrader? Did you use this method to solve latency issue to win the competition? I&#39;m sure latency is terrible when trading from Sydney.
@César Centeno Good to hear that César. I watched the interview you were in it and was really inspired to see someone trading all the way from Aus. I think this method will indeed help with the data congestion especially during the open. So i heard you trade mostly 1 and 5 minute ORB, what&#39;s your average Das latency after applying this method? Do you rely on reading level 2 and the tape? because that&#39;s the biggest concern when it comes to latency.
Thanks for watching!
@sammy tong Hello Sammy, Thank you for your email. I did watch this video before. I had some conversations with people from DAS and they suggested this method. I changed my internet provider and the problem is better now. Thank you so much for your message.. How are you doing ??
Thanks for sharing
Mine is a black windows in free trial, but it runned
Verify which image you&#39;ve chosen. It sounds like you selected &#39;dc-core&#39; type. Check out the standard one for full graphic interface windows experience
@storagefreak Oh yeah thank you it worked with free trial!!!
superb! My &#39;free trial&#39; period is long gone, but what I suspect: as long as the account is &#39;upgraded&#39; to paid/billing address account, you can still use your credit, and therefore create Windows VMs :)
it&#39;s not work on a free 300$ trial account you have any idea?
I can&#39;t select gpu :(
what&#39;&#39;s the cost?
To the point video. Just what I needed. Just a heads up. While setting up a payment method, use a credit card. A debit card won&#39;t work. Also if the credit card has been used for setting up another VM instance of Google, then it won&#39;t work. As one card cannot be the billing settings of multiple accounts. Also, to use the VM instance feature under the free trial, click the activate button on top left corner. 👍

Great guy he spent 10 credits to a 6 minute video for teaching us 👏👏👏
you are life saving man... thanks
When I open it with the RDP file it is just a black screen :(
Hi you most likely have chosen image with <b>core</b> in the name - which has minimal graphical interface support. Try to choose an base image which is not core ;)
@storagefreak You mean the OS? Like i have chosen windows server 2019 core so i should choose no core right?
Yes :) try that
@storagefreak thx very much it worked👍

@storagefreak you help me a lots thank you so much. may God bless you.
why when i get in it show only command and black back ground, it dose not show any window. pls help me thank you
Basically you can&#39;t create Remote Desktop on Google Cloud, they only allow SSH connections.
Windows VM instances are not included with the free trial. To use them, first enable billing on your account. You&#39;ll still be able to apply your free trial credits to eligible products and services.

Are you planning to deplatform any of company that uses your service on a 1 day notice? Apparently, you have section 230 but the companies that use your service do not
i think i got an example, im building an app backend where i need to pull data from an api and generate custom results for each user based on that.<br /><br />i could do this using a couple queues and topics on gcp or i could use this service to pull the data and process it with my cloud functions, after that send a message to my users notifying that the data is available
Suppose you have a claim application where employee raise claims. It is required to integrate claims application with SAP. SAP provides Rest API endpoint for integration.<br />Once claims are approved those claims should be uploaded to SAP at night. <br />You can use Google workflows to get claims from your claim application and then post those claims to SAP each night. <br />First you will create a step in workflow that will read all approved claims from the claim app database.<br />Then for each claim or you can even batch them and then you will post those claims to SAP. <br />Basically this use case is integrating two application: claim app and SAP.
In a nutshell, Workflows allows you to connect ‘things’ together. Pretty much anything that has a public API. You can connect multiple Cloud Functions together, or mix-match Cloud Functions with Cloud Run services with Google Cloud APIs or even external APIs. This article might give you a better idea: <a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/a-first-look-at-serverless-orchestration-with-workflows-d80e41e9e04f">https://medium.com/google-cloud/a-first-look-at-serverless-orchestration-with-workflows-d80e41e9e04f</a>

wow Google
All that security to protect our data??, yet they let our details and browsing history be shared all over the net using cookies and data correlation.
@abhishek mane If a component fails to pass a performance test, it’s deemed no longer usable. To prevent any sensitive information from living on that disk, we remove it from inventory to be erased and destroyed in Layer 6, Disk Erase.
@Stephanie Wong Got it. Thank you so much. Completed Qwiklabs course for cloud developer, Ur videos were very helpful. Great work 💯

Why are they destroying the disk in layer 6 and not reusing it for the next customer by formatting it ?

That is really well designed and protected , whichever consultant designed it, must be pro in it . Great to see this much level of security by Google in person. Well less security on the actual cloud from invisible online people !
Is it a good idea to show off security features to the public? Is google underestimating the power of a computer nerd?
You need to cross all the 6 level security check just to see the Disk Shredder. Lol🤣🤣.

Good thing government hackers and third parties don&#39;t have to go in there to get your data.
Think that when an earthquake with 10.0 scale rating is happend there🥴
Next war will target a few Azure, AWS, &amp; GCP data centers and we will be done. Between cancel culture and total consolidation of infrastructure this seems very dangerous. Should be selling the tools, equipment, and methodology for customers to operate as a cloud in their own data centers.

Is the high probability they had a cameraman from Google&#39;s public affairs office shoot this ., who was already cleared to do this in advance. I am a retired security officer in both private and public sector ., and based on my experience their physical and internal security may not be 100% foolproof but it is damn close. Just think of it this way we have never had any public closure of one of these sites being penetrated. This complex is a hard nut to crack. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see design features used by the NSA for their data centers come from what Google has done for theirs. remember sites like these are not even physically connected to the internet in most cases.
I kind of doubt the computer techs mop the floor and paint/clean the walls, even in the most inner layer. Cleaning and maintenance people must also pass security. Of course, a 9.0 earthquake directly below the complex will make for a bad day for anyone at the data center. Then there is worrying about inside jobs. Of course, if there is a fire and everyone needs to run for their lives at once, it&#39;s the hell with the one person at a time rule.
If ever there will be another splinter cell, this should be part of a mission!

And yet the biggest risk to security with Google... is Google itself. <br /><br />&quot;We don&#39;t sell your personal information.&quot; They say. No Google, you&#39;re right, you don&#39;t &quot;sell&quot; it... you charge a subscription fee for it.

this entire video feels more like its trying to challenge people rather than give a strong sense of security.

The core of the monopoly.
99.99% of the hackers would never attempt to break through the 6-layers of security with an armoured truck or anything of that sort, instead they would just hack into the data while sitting at the comfort of their home. So, all these layers of security is basically useless and a waste of money.

Lo dices para luego que creas tu pag web poder ganar dinero con los anuncios? Claro que sí.
se puede usar con una cuenta de google adsense
Despues de un año gratis, si aún quieres mantener la web, te van a cobrar. Ellos primero te preguntan si quieres seguír con el servicio de hosting. El dominio si lo puedes mantener por siempre gratis, solo tienes q renovar cada 12 meses :)
Mmmm, entiendo, gracias por la info :D &lt;3
¿Se puede tener gratis para siempre de por vida?, ¿o Google Cloud es solo por un año gratis y después te borra la web, o te cobra o algo así?
si iniciaste tu servidor apache?
hola michell, tengo una pequeña duda, no se si me puedas responder, yo quiero subir una pagina en html php css , al hosting, pero si lo subo desde google cloud sdk shell , se sube el proyecto, pero no me agarra los estilos ni nada de lo demas, y aparte no se ven los archivos que subi, no se donde se suben
Hola Angelica, cuando ya tengas WordPress instalado, puedes crear varios usuarios en el mismo. Tu decides que rol le das a esa persona, si sera un admin como tú o sera solo un editor, etc. No se si me entiendes?
Entiendo, puedo configurar su acceso solo a wordpress sin que vea el gmail. Gracias
Exacto. De igual forma el acceso de cada uno será con contraseñas distintas que usted misma crea.
Hola, gracias por el vídeo, tengo una duda, si yo le quiero dar acceso a otra persona para que edite la pagina web, ¿esta persona debe tener acceso al correo electrónico de gmail? es que no estoy segura si usar mi gmail personal o crear una cuenta nueva exclusivamente para la pagina web.<br /><br />Gracias de antemano.
Ya te expiró?
@Vince Veggie y como se renueva, necesitas pagar?
@Dafne Rodriguez así es ya ha pasado un año y no renové
¡Gracias me sirvió de mucho!
para moodle seria lo mismo??
Desde freenom tiene un webmail propio que puede abrir las bandejas del email gratis que deja crear
Excelente tutorial, te explicaste muy bien! Si tengo un pregunta, en el caso de usar hosting con cpanel uno ahi tiene el webmail para usar el correo corporativo. En este caso que el servidor es google cloud ¿como uno puede abrir el correo corporativo (con el dominio) sin pagar? Saludos
soy el 10000
@Mich Tutos pagando o gratuito ?
Hola. Si se puede, yo lo hice. Pero tendría que hacer otro video para explicarlo.

Solo ingresa a phpMyAdmin, luego a tu base de datos, exportas tus archivos como SQL. Luego te vas al nuevo hosting, creas una nueva base de datos en MySQL. Luego de vas al phpMyAdmin de ese nuevo hosting y le das a importar los archivos SQL que descargastes de tu viejo hosting. De todos modos tu nuevo servidor te puede dar una guía.
Sabes como cambiar de hosting? Quiero cambiar de 000webhosting al de Google me ayudarías bastante.

No funciono :(
Excelente tutorial, mil gracias!!!
Grax lo intentare
Me marca error en el correo de Hot y Gmail. :(
Excelente Michell,gracias y si es por el ingles ,esta muy bien!!!!&#39;
manga de parasitos, vayan a laburar si no les gusta.. todavía que les da tremenda facilidades para obtener un hosting para pagar en un año se quejan jajaj, esta gente es la tipica comoda que quiere todo de arriba
Como dice en el video te regalan un credito de 300 dolares para usar por un lapso de 12 meses. Si es regalado es gratis no?
ingenuos nada es gratis esta es una marihuana machorruda
Gratis y te descuentan ?
Ya, Estas usando su youtube! para guardar archivos de video, su gmail para tus correos, etc., al fin le aparecio una competencia seria a AWS, antes teniamos digital oceans,
@J Guti y Azure de microsoft.
nada es gratis. si como no te lo va n a devolver jajaja
Si no te gusta no lo hagas amigo, no es tutorial obligatorio, puedes pagar tu plan anual en Hostinger, Go Daddy o cualquier otro portal y todos felices :) Saluditos
nada es gratis
Muchas gracias, aunque no use Wordpress me ayudo mucho. Esta muy bien que existan estos vídeos. Algún día me animare a subir tutos sobre esta y otras plataformas de azure hay muy poca información sobre estos temas. :)
te amo
¡Genial Michell! ¡Viva Panamá!
te funcionó finalmente?
Una pregunta.<br />Porque cuando yo creo el dominio y al momento de comprarlo me sale que no pudieron ser creados y me manda al inicio. (En la pagina de freenom)
te funcionó?
@Spectre Tienda si, sigo utilizando el google cloud pero el dominio Freenom al parecer ya no sirve
@Yafel y estas usando otro dominio? puedo ver tu website porfavor! no te han cobrado nada?
@Spectre Tienda No, solo estoy usando el cloud con su IP <a href="http://35.224.2.2/">http://35.224.2.2/</a><br />No, no me han cobrado nada, te dan 300 dls para usarlos
Funciona perfectamente, Muchas gracias!
te funcionó? te han cobrado algo?
eres la mejor eres wooow muchas gracias explicastes muy excelente
ahora cuentas con un nuevo suscriptor
hola todo bien solo que no me coge el https que hicemal?
yo estoy usando TiendaNube, de donde saco la direccion IPv4?
suscribe-te y me suscribo no fake!
hola que cliente ftp y donde esta el acceso ftp
Hola Michell, me encantó tu video, estuvo muy explícita tu exposición y te ganaste un suscriptor más conmigo por ese tan excelente trabajo tuyo. Te Felicito.
En cual?
al querer registrar el dominio me da error: Some of your domains could not be registered because of a technical error.
a mi no me sirvió nada el tema de el dominio no me recibe nada
Asi es, sigue funcionando por algo este video lo tengo entre mis favoritos. Saludos desde LIMA PERÚ. Por cierto FREENOM tiene un BUG y es que para tener los dominios gratis primero debemos dar clic en registro y luego poner tu dominio y seleccionar la terminación(.tk , .ml , etc) solo eso.
Hola, si estas utilizando la version de WordPress Bitnami en Google Cloud, este cambio lo tienes que hacer directamente en el archivo wp-config.php. Lo puedes hacer accediendo por SSH y luego &quot;sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/wp-config.php&quot;. No obstante deberías utilizar una IP estática y en la zona DNS ingresar correctamente los registros A y CNAME, y en unos momentos deberías acceder a tu WordPress sin problemas con el nombre de tu dominio. Saludos
Disculpe no pude cambiar la url del dominio en ajustes de worpress en la ip externa
Hola, prueba borrando la cache de tu smartphone sino espera es simplemente mientras se propagan los DNS. Saludos
Hola ya cargo la pagina pero en mi laptop pero en smartphone no
La ip de l hosting no direcciona...es como si el servidor no funcionara

Yes
GRAN VIDEO! me encanto! <br />tengo algunas dudas: ¿Seguirá funcionando así en 2020? ¿Sirve para registrar en adcense?
Usas Youtube que es de google y te has de comer anuncios (no es su principal negocio), tambien has de usar su correo (no solo para youtube) sin contar su buscador, quizas un celular andriod (que tambien es de google), sin contar las apps de tu telefono que tendras una que otra de GOOGLE ya DAS LAS NALGAS (informacion tuya que esa es la que les interesa) y te conocen mejor que nadie, no te hacen ningun cargo, SOLO ES PARA EVITAR bots que se aprovechen de esos 300 dolares que dan de inicio, porque esa herramienta no solo sirve para hacer paginas, maquinas virtuales, trabajar con apis, etc
necesitas tarjeta de credito!!! nada es gratis entonces!!!

si es una prueva gratis pra que te pide tarjeta de credito suena a gato encerrado ojo gente
As uno con html,css,js como subirlo co Google
se pone los datos de una tarjeta solo para completar ese espacio? no habra ningun recargo cierto en tanto tenga aun los 300 dolares?, y cuando esta por teminar como lo puedo cancelar para que no consumas mas?
Gracias muy bien explicado yo soy nuevo en Google cloud y saludo desde Peru
Excelente Gracias !!
Excelente Gracias !!
Si
Disculpa la pregunta. al que tiempo de utilizarlo te cobrarón esa cantidad?
Saludos señorita, usted dijo que la suscripción es gratis y a mi me acaban de cobrar de mi targeta 58 dolares, esto es una estafa.
Excelente tutorial, ¡muchas gracias!
Hay muchas diferencias en cuanto a precio dependieeeeendo de lo que necesites. Ej: si necesitas más espacio en el disco Google tal vez te cobra más por más espacio en el disco que Amazon (no digo que sea así lo pongo a modo de ejemplo porque la variación de precio va en relación a esas características) no se si ya lo sabes pero la intención es aportar :D

despues de crear todo y entrar al wordpres sale que la pagina no es segura como hago para que no salga eso.
se puede cambiar para que mi pagina aparezca como seguro? porque veo que a ti tambien te sale la pagina no es segura.
muchas gracias por el video. Quisiera saber que pasa luego de completar el año de prueba ¿Cuales serian los costos o consideraciones a tener en cuenta?
Excelente presentacion amiga.
No copiaste o colocaste bien las dns en tu dominio
Hice todo como en el vídeo pero solo puedo ver la página como admin y cuando entró desde otro dispositivo me dice que no se encontró el servidor DNS que debo hacer?

tienes el virus de chromium en tu pc, es el google de color azul
El crédito se gasta para muchos de los servicios de google como sus API de traducciones, su nube, etc. Si escoges otro plan si te deja utilizar el crédito pero como dijo la chica con el crédito te deja utilizar máximo 8 cpu
MUCHAS GRACIAS POR EL VIDEO!<br />Por favor ayudame con unas inquietudes<br />1. Al momento que escoges la capacidad de almacenamiento, tu escogiste lo mas económico; yo me pregunto en que mas se gasta el crédito porque sino se podria escoger mayor capacidad para que no te quede un saldo del credito tan grande sin utilizar<br />2. Luego de haber escogido la capacidad de almacenamiento económica, es posible cambiarse a otra de mayor capacidad dentro del mismo año sin coste adicional, utilizando el mismo crédito?<br />Muchas gracias, espero tu respuesta
te amo, por fin algo que me ayudo
Sinceramente me ayudó mucho el tuto, solo me faltaba nomás la última configuración, muchas gracias en serio.
si pongo la ip, jala muy bien, pero si pongo la dirección del dominio me aperece: No se puede acceder a este sitio web :(
Felicitaciones el video esta muy explicito<br />* una pregunta porque le puso &quot;@&quot; y no &quot;www&quot; gracias de antemano
alguien sabe como obtener subdominios de frenom?
Hola Michell Concepción un vídeo excelente de gran ayuda, continua haciendo vídeos públicos como estos, por ejemplo como lograr obtener un backup de wordpress o de google cloud. Un suscritor mas a tu canal de youtube
genial el tuto. fusiono a la perfección. <br />sería maravilloso si se pudiera crear correos corporativos con esta dirección Xd. <br />Sld
hola! exelnte video. pèro los DNS no me lo reconoce en GoDaddy a que se debe ?gx
Me gustó tu vídeo hablas muy natural. eso me gusta. Éxitos en tu canal.
bueno esta pandemia me ha dejado limpio jajaja, me servirá para almacenar por lo menos un año el sitio hasta que todo se resuelva, saludos y gracias
Y el dominio?
En serio me funcionó, Panamá representing!!!! Felicidades
no me funciono al abrir el usuario no entra a ningún host
tu cuenta es gratis por siempre? y solo compra servicio adicionales?
Funciona, el problema es cuando pasa un año, pierdes TODO!!!
Hola Excelente Video, espero que me ayuden con una duda que tengo, en cuanto a pros y contras que hay entre tener mi pagina web en google cloud a tener mi pagina en un hosting comprado, es más caro, más barato; cual es mas rápido; porque tener mi pagina en google cloud o porque tener mi pagina en un hosting, cuan beneficioso es Google cloud en comparación con los hosting que ofrecen los proveedores de hostings. Espero su respuesta
es verdaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad lo acabo de ver ,malisimo
Muchas gracias por tu video, ha sido muy claro. Solo por curiosidad, si contratas un servicio de 51 dolares al año, que puedes hacer con el saldo restante? Saludos.
Tendrias mas suscriptores si te dedicases un poco mas a responder las consultas o a aquellos que te agradecen...se le llama educacion?
Parece que en Argentina siempre nos joden, solo nos dan 90 dias de prueba en lugar de 12 meses.
a partir del segundo año toca pagar casi mas que wordpress?

Not judging, but funny how this is Google, yet I see an Apple watch somewhere in the video
Hi Siddhesh! It can be featured in the certification exams, but it will be more of a focus in the Cloud Network Engineer cert. Good luck studying!
Good Content! Thanks! Can you do me a favor? Does this new functionality have a chance to get appear in cloud certification exams?
Niceaaa
Thanks for the content. Please provide more videos about interconnect in hpc cases.
That&#39;s the Partner Interconnect option, going through a partner instead of directly to Google. Handy when doing multi-cloud to on-prem connections, when you can&#39;t meet Google at their Interconnect locations or when you don&#39;t need a full 1 Gbps cable
Great stuff. Stephanie covers the colocation solution but that can be expensive. There are technologies like Pureport that let you directly VPN to Interconnect, even from AWS or MSFT that lower the fees to from $1000&#39;s a month to $100&#39;s.
Very well explained; good job.
To clarify, Dedicated Interconnect means setting up a GCP Cloud Router. Cloud Router peers with your on-premises VPN gateway or router. It dynamically advertises routes to your on premise peer.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKaryf7qp9w&amp;t=03m54s">03:54</a> dedicated interconnect uses peering to communicate on internal IPs ? something is wrong I guess...
Big fraude
good explaination and 5 stars for google cloud
Nice userinterface on Google cloud add some more gateways but great simple handling and using google cloud is simple 5 STARS
Is this a faster version of MPLS?
Hi Piyush, you can take a snapshot of the persistent disk, create a new VM it in your custom VPC, then attach your snapshot to it. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/create-snapshots">https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/create-snapshots</a><br /><a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk#create_disk">https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk#create_disk</a>
I have migrated a VM to GCP but it got configured in default VPC and i cant move those migrated VMs to Customer VPC. Kindly suggest a solution.
How could we choose a liable service provider in local area? And when it&#39;s bankrupt or can&#39;t operate services.. How could we get a compensation?
I&#39;m planning on doing more videos in this series and will make a note of your suggestion ☺️
is there any possibility to post a video about using partner interconnect ?
Great video!<br /><br />I highly recommend to Google Marketing team to decrease the precision of this product price from $1, 700.00 to just $1,700<br />When I see so many zeros on my screen I start to get a little scared :D
Yes you can do a private connection between on prem and the cloud without public IPs by using Cloud Interconnect. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKaryf7qp9w&amp;t=3m48s">3:48</a>.
i want a bidirectional connection between on-pem and gcp. however there is no public IP assigned to GCP VP instances. So, using the dedicated interconnect can the on-prem server ping the private IP of GCP VM?

How to upgrade VLAN attachment capacity?
Can you provide insight into testing the connectivity via the Network API?
Hola! No te va a funciuonar. Bitnami tiene su propio paquete de LEts Encrypt y su método en particular según donde se instale. Saludos.
No me funcionó en Bitnami de GCP :(
Hola! Gracias por tu comentario. Este método no sirve para wordpress en kubernetes. Para poder hacerlo te recomiendo que instales otro microservicio con un nginx y debtro del nginx instales el certbot. El nginx debe funcionar como un proxi reverso. PEro si eres el admministrador del kubernetes lo mejor es instalar el certificado en los proxies reversos del cluster. Como verás, es un tema un poco mas complejo y que se debe analizar en detalle según tus necesidades y la arquitectura que estés utilizando. Saludos.
@Apuntes IT Muchas gracias por responder tan rápido. ¿Habrá alguna forma que me puedas apoyar? ¿Cuál sería el costo? Sé que no es el lugar para este tipo de cosas, pero si pudiera contactarte de otra manera. Saludos, quedo a la espera de tu respuesta.
@Cesar Marin Gracias por la consulta, pero no realizo trabajos particulares. Tengo mi trabajo formal que me consume la mayor parte del día y el resto lo dedico a compartir conocimientos en el canal. En el blog encontrarás todos mis medios de contacto. En qué plataforma tienes funcionando el wordpress? Ya sé que está en un cluster de Kubernetes, pero en cuál proveedor? Quizá pueda encontrarte alguna ayuda extra o quizá algún otro amigo del canal. Abrazos!
@Apuntes IT Está en Google Cloud, muchas gracias!!
@Cesar Marin Mira, para poder hacer uso de Let&#39;s Encrypt en Kubernetes debes instalar HELM si es que no lo tienes y luego agregar un repositorio donde se provee un proyecto que genera todo lo necesario para poder sacar los certificados. Luego, haciendo uso de Nginx debes redirigir las peticiones públicas hacia tu Wordpress. Si te animas puedes seguir este artículo que muestra como hacerlo. <a href="https://medium.com/cloud-prodigy/configure-letsencrypt-and-cert-manager-with-kubernetes-3156981960d9">https://medium.com/cloud-prodigy/configure-letsencrypt-and-cert-manager-with-kubernetes-3156981960d9</a> De todos modos verés de generar un artículo con este tema en el blog y en los próximos videos. Si te es de ayuda te pido que me apoyes con tu suscripción al canal. Saludos.
@Apuntes IT Perfecto, muchas GRACIAS por tu ayuda, tienes un suscriptor más!!!
@Cesar Marin Yo también tengo ese problema amigo, tengo listo WordPress en kubernetes pero no se como activadr ssl , tu ya lo lograste?
Excelente tutorial. Disculpa, tengo una duda, ¿este método sirve en un wordpress instalado con kubernetes? Saludos y muchas gracias de antemano!!!

Hola dednedi, el video va estar listo el lunes en la tarde, te estaremos informando. Saludos
Muchas gracias, este video me fue de mucha ayuda, pero oye una cosa... como le coloco https, ya después de asignarle un dominio...?
Hola, estamos por subir los próximos videos, para trasladar una página ya hecha en WordPress, debes utilizar el plugin All-in-One WP Migration. Con esto puedes migrar el sitio desde cualquier otro hosting o dominio. Saludos
gracias :)
Hola , felicidades por el video , son los unicos que dan una solicion en español. Mi pregunta es como puedo subir una página ya hecha en wordpress? o debo volver a hacerla desde cero si uso este método.<br />Y por favor suban la otra parte del video de como cambiar el dominio y los certificados SSL. Se lo agradeceriamos muchimo<br />Gracias
Hola, los siguientes videos donde puedo encontrarlos, en el perfil solo sale publico este
Hola Erick, por qué no pruebas cambiando la zona o region de &quot;us-east-1b&quot; a otra. Vamos a montar un video sobre backups en Google Cloud, pero esta programado para dentro de dos semanas. Saludos
hola gracias por el aporte <br />wordpress-3 tiene advertencias de recurso
 <br />wordpress-3-vm: {&quot;ResourceType&quot;:&quot;compute.v1.instance&quot;,&quot;ResourceErrorCode&quot;:&quot;ZONE_RESOURCE_POOL_EXHAUSTED&quot;,&quot;ResourceErrorMessage&quot;:&quot;The zone &#39;projects/lubri-ar/zones/us-east1-b&#39; does not have enough resources available to fulfill the request.

Hola podrías eliminar la instancia, e instalar nuevamente wordpress en una nueva instancia. Bitnami por defecto viene con PHP 7 y si haces las pruebas de costos es más económico que la versión de Google Deploy. Saludos
saludos como puedo eliminar bitnami y agregar otro word pres y porque elegiste w pr2ss bitnami gracias
¡Muchas gracias, me ayudó mucho!
Hola Ethan, sigue los pasos es muy sencillo. Saludos
@Pietti hola que tal podrias ayudarme a salir del cmd?<br />en este momento estoy en eso eh ingresado ctrl + x y luego y ya se guardo pero no logro salir puedo seleccionar la x para salir y listo?

@ethan gonzalez Si no hay problema lo puedes cerrar en caso de que necesites puedes volver a abrirlo sin ningún problema nuevamente mediante Compute Engine, VM Instances, y luego SSH. Saludos
me estanque en la parte de ingresar comando ...
ahh xD ya lo vi
bien explicado gracias
Soy de Venezuela y no m toma la tarjeta de crédito que hagooo
Hola NovatoWTF, debes habilitar la facturación si cumples las condiciones tendrás un año o 300 dolares gratis, deben existir los datos para poder facturarte sin embargo no te van a generar ningún cobro. Saludos.
Hola Karinnis, debes probar con otra tarjeta o utilizando un VPN para cambiar de país cuando creas la cuenta. Saludos
Por que cuando intento hacer algo dice que Tengo Que hacer facturacion si estoy en la prueba gratis ?
Hola Robert, debes comunicarte con soporte de google, recuerda que cuando se acaba el periodo gratis ya sea los $300 dolares o los 12 meses, lo que se cumpla primero, debes manualmente habilitar la facturación ya que en este periodo Google no te hace ningún cobro automático, una vez habilitado te harán los cobros automáticamente a tu cuenta o tarjeta. Los servicios los podrás utilizar cuando este resuelto el tema de facturación. Es importante que si utilizas la periodo de prueba hagas seguimiento de los cargos para tener en cuenta cuando se acabara el saldo gratis o el tiempo. Saludos
Hola tengo una cuenta pero me la bloquearon por facturacion y no piedo usar ningun servicio sin embargo hoy me llego un correo diciendo que Su facturacion de Su Dominio GJTSOODC6 ESTA DIAPONIBLE LO EXTEAÑO ES QUE NO SOLOCITE NINGUN DOMINIO Y ME COBRARAN EN AUTOMATICO PUEDES AYUDARME?
Hola Robert, el primer año es gratis así que creo que no puedes encontrar algo mas económico en el mercado, después de ese año puedes trasladar la instalación de WordPress a otro servidor si así lo quieres, es un proceso muy fácil. De todas maneras te recomiendo probarlo notaras una gran diferencia con respecto a los servidores compartidos. Saludos.
@Pietti bueno en realidad quiero saber si Mientras descargo plugins y subo artículos WordPress peaaria más y se aumentaría el peso De WordPress en Google. O siempre será los 15 Dólares de descarga?
Hola Robert, por estos 15 dolares aproximadamente tienes un disco SSD de 10 GB mas que suficiente para la instalación de WordPress, el costo se puede ver aumentado mas por el trafico hacia tu sitio web que por los plugins instalados. Saludos
@Pietti Ah ok Ahora Si Muchas Gracias.
OYE SIGIE HACIENDO TUTORIALES SOBRE ESTO
Los precios son muy elevados luego de que pasa el año pretendo hacer una tienda
Si en alguna ocasión me pidieron documentos de verificación, es un proceso sencillo de realizar. Saludos
por que piden documentos de verificacion ?
A usted le pasó que Google le bloqueado el proyecto para que les envié documentos de verificación? Ami me paso
Genial el tutorial.
Hola Eddwin, para esto debe utilizar la version Multisitio de Google Clic Deploy si quieres controlar desde una sola instalación de WordPress varias paginas con dominios distintos. Si lo que quieres es un dominio para el sitio web y los otros se redirijan automáticamente al principal solo debes redireccionarlos. Saludos
@Pietti Gracias por la respuesta, Debería de crear un DNS para cada sitio?
@Eddwin Guzmán Si para cada dominio debes habilitar su propio DNS. Saludos
Saludos, me pregunto como sería la configuración para instalar wordpress y usar varios dominios, en que cambia la configuración?

Hola Andres, estas utilizando algún plugin de cache? de todas maneras puedes borrar la cache asociada a pagespeed reiniciando Apache mediante SSH con el comando &quot;sudo /opt/bitnami/<a href="http://ctlscript.sh/">ctlscript.sh</a> restart apache&quot;. Saludos
@Pietti Perfecto, lo intentaré, actualicé un plugin que me desconfinguró un par de cosas de estilos. Me indican en soporte que borre el cache de la nube.
Saludos desde Costa Rica, una consulta que no tiene mucho que ver con el tema, pero no lo encuentro. Sabe como borrar cache en GCP Wordpress con Bitnami? Agradezco de antemano toda tu ayuda.
Hola Andres, escríbeme a través de la pagina <a href="http://pietti.com/">pietti.com</a> y con gusto veo si puedo ayudarte. Saludos
Saludos, muy agradecido con toda su ayuda. Sin duda hemos desplegado todo gracias a sus videos. Tenemos un problema con otro sitio, también está en GCP, brinda usted soporte privado a ver si podemos resolver ese problema? Gracias de antemano
Hola Andres, pueden ser diarias he visto sin ningún problema de rendimiento hasta 500 simultaneas en horas picos. De todas maneras Google Cloud realizara un análisis de tu sitio y te sugerirá si es necesario que aumentes la capacidad o la disminuyas de acuerdo al trafico y recursos necesario de tu proyecto. Saludos
@Pietti muchas muchas por los tutoriales. El sitio ya está andando. Y bastante bien todo
@Samer Navarrosaludos si está a mi alcance con mucho gusto
@Andrés Guido oye pregunta, no entiendo :( .. Tienes 1 año gratuito ? y es caro ? es que no veo los costos exactos..
excelente tutorial, Consulta, esa VM que escogiste,, hablas de 5000 a 25000 visitas, cuantas conexiones simultáneas puede recibir sin ver afectado su rendimiento? Saludos desde Costa Rica
Hola Andres, si puedes aumentar o disminuir VM sin ningún problema y es muy sencillo de hacer. Saludos
@Pietti perfecto. Ya estoy viendo la documentación de Google. Saludos y nuevamente gracias. Saludos desde Costa Rica
Y la máquina virtual que escogemos se puede cambiar si el sitio así lo amerita? Por ejemplo que aumente el tráfico? Muchas gracias de antemano
Brillante tutorial, muy bien explicado, con el tiempo justo y el paso a paso muy claro, muchas gracias, después de fracasar en el primer intento y pasar 15 horas peleando con soporte porque no podía enlazar el dominio me di cuenta que al copiar los registros NS y pegarlos en el proveedor de dominios que en mi caso era Enom, me marcaba error, y nunca me resolvieron, al grado que tuve que comprar otro dominio, para que me arrojara el mismo error, gracias a este tutorial me di cuenta que los registros tenían un punto extra es decir terminaban en .com. al quitar los puntos se arreglo todo por arte de magia.. de nuevo mil gracias por el tiempo dedicado.
Excelente tutorial, con el tiempo adecuado y explicado muy claramente, gracias por el tiempo
Hola cuando cuando creas la instancia y dependiendo de la configuración que elijas el te da un promedio de costo, el cual debes dividir dentro de los $300 dolares o 12 Meses gratis, por lo cual tu promedio de instancias creadas no debería pasar de 25 dolares mensuales. Saludos
Hola, cuantos instancias Gratis puedo tener en google cloud mediante los 12 meses
Buen video, sólo un comentario, no grabes con pantalla tan grande, ya que si los usuarios vemos el video en una pantalla de menor resolución, la información no se alcanza a visualizar. Saludos
Hola, esta infraestructura es flexible y escalable, te recomendaría una configuración mínima de 1 CPU con 6.5GB de RAM, Google Cloud te informara si es necesario después de analizar tu consumo que subas o bajes tu configuración, la cual puedes cambiar sin ningún problema en tu VM Instance. Saludos
Hola ,estoy recibiendo un promedio de 200.000 visitas al mes, me servira esta opción?
Hola Humberto, depende de el consumo de recursos que hagan los visitantes. Puedes tener un estimado del precio ingresando los datos en esta calculadora de AWS <a href="https://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">https://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</a>. Saludos
Un website con 30mil visitas al mes cuanto puede llegar a costar al mes con AWS despues del año gratis que da Amazon??? o donde puedo conocer las tarifas para saber si luego tengo que pagar o por la cantidad de visitas me quedo gratis por las reglas que el pone???
Hola Jonathan lo puedes hacer aumentando la capacidad subida de archivos de WordPress te recomiendo ver este video: <a href="https://youtu.be/z5ORkl8DsDg">https://youtu.be/z5ORkl8DsDg</a>. Es importante que cambies también el valor del post_max_size, detengas la instancia y la reinicies después de hacer el cambio. Otra alternativa es por FTP para esto te recomiendo este link: <a href="https://www.onepagezen.com/google-cloud-ftp-filezilla-quick-start/">https://www.onepagezen.com/google-cloud-ftp-filezilla-quick-start/</a>. Saludos
Hola, disculpa la pregunta. Si quiero subir un tema que tengo, pero esta un poco pesado. como lo puedo subir ?.. Usualmente usaba el cpanel de mi hosting, pero con google cloud no se por donde. Te agradeceria mucho tu apoyo :) ..
Hola Jonathan, lo tendremos en cuenta para próximos videos. Saludos
Saludos, muy buenos los vídeos, podrías hacer un vídeo de como crear una maquina virtual en GCP y como subir archivos.
Gracias Marcelo, tenia programado hacer uno sobre CloudFlare CDN tal vez lo integre en un solo video y haga una comparación, lo tendré en cuenta. Saludos
@Pietti Bueno, ya que has iniciado una serie de google cloud, comentarte que he buscado por youtube y nadie habla sobre eso. Serías el primero. De cloudflare, hay muchos. :) Eso no quita, que hagas lo que consideres claro. Es una humilde opinion de usuario que busco como instalar y configurar el cdn de google en wordpress.
@marcelo astorga lo tendré en cuenta para un próximo video. Aquí te paso un link que te puede servir: <a href="https://geekflare.com/google-cloud-cdn-test/">https://geekflare.com/google-cloud-cdn-test/</a>. Nos cuentas como resulta. Saludos
@Pietti lo miro y te comento.
Primero de todo, muchas felicidades por tus tutoriales. Tengo una consulta. Tienes previsto hacer un tutorial de como instalar un cdn de google cloud? Ya que es el mejor cdn que hay segun el ranking actual, estaría bien ya que dominas google cloud :). Felicidades por tus vídeos!.
Hola Carlos, es un stack de Bitnami en este caso, funciona como WordPress normal, pero algunos archivos tienen una ubicación distinta. Saludos
Pietti Gracias
Una pregunta, es una instalación de Wordpress como si lo instalara en cualquier otro server o tiene alguna restricción? Gracias
Hola Louis, si estas utilizando una instalación de WordPress Bitnami, estas lineas te deben aparecer en el archivo wp-config.php. Saludos
Cuando abro el config.php via ssh no encuentro ningun codigo similar a este para cambiar: define(&#39;WP_SITEURL&#39;, &#39;http://&#39; . $_SERVER[&#39;HTTP_HOST&#39;] . &#39;/&#39;);<br />define(&#39;WP_HOME&#39;, &#39;http://&#39; . $_SERVER[&#39;HTTP_HOST&#39;] . &#39;/&#39;);
@Pietti En vez de Compute Engine deberia de ir a &gt; Deploy Manager
Hola, debes ingresar a tu cuenta de <a href="http://cloud.google.com/">cloud.google.com</a>, una vez adentro con tu cuenta debes ir a Compute Engine &gt; VM Instance y dar clic sobre la instancia que se creo, ahí te aparecerán los datos de acceso y claves para ingresar a tu instalación de WordPress en Google Cloud. Saludos
Gracias por el tutorial Rafael. Me funciono perfecto, pero una vez cerré el proyecto, al intentar acceder de nuevo al dia siguiente no veo la forma de hacerlo a traves de google clouds, podrias por favor decirme como se hace? gracias
Hola Mauricio, puedes ingresar mediante la dirección IP que te dio, sino la anotaste o la recuerdas, debes ingresar <a href="http://cloud.google.com/">cloud.google.com</a> con tu cuenta, vas a Compute Engine &gt; VM Instance y das clic sobre la tu instancia y ahí te muestra toda la información dirección IP y contraseñas para ingresar. Saludos
Hola Rafael, después de instalar wordpress Bitnami en Google Cloud cerré y ahora no sé cómo abrirlo para editar agregar una plantilla y editarla. Sabes cómo hacerlo? alguien sabe cómo hacerlo?
Tongo una consulta adicional, he creado una VM y subí mi pagina, siguiento tus tutoriales, pero me a surgido un problema, no puedo ingresar a wordpress, ni con el user que se genera automaticamente, ni con el usuario (admin) que creé. sabes cual puede ser el problema? Gracias
Hola, Rafael, muchas gracias por tus videos, son muy utiles. Tengo algunas consultas, no he encontrado si se puede, o como se debe hacer si queremos tener mas de un sitio, y que los servidores estén en distintas ubicaciones, en mi caso una pagina esta enfocada en Sudamerica y otra a Europa. Conoces algún tutorial al respecto? muchas gracias!
Hola Alexander, si lo puedes hacer sin ningún problema, te recomiendo ver este tutorial <a href="https://youtu.be/RnMpc5ofOm0">https://youtu.be/RnMpc5ofOm0</a>. Saludos
Si quisiera hacer el traslado de mi wordpress que esta en un hosting normal (Hostgator) a Google Cloud Platform ¿Cómo lo puedo hacer?
Hola Alexander si puedes acceder. Estaremos montando tutoriales sobre esto sin embargo te recomiendo este tutorial mientras tanto: <a href="https://www.onepagezen.com/google-cloud-ftp-filezilla-quick-start/">https://www.onepagezen.com/google-cloud-ftp-filezilla-quick-start/</a>. Saludos
¿Cómo puedo acceder a un FTP o sFTP? ¿Cómo puedo acceder al admin de la base de datos? Seria genial si me puedes colaborar.
Hola Alexander, si existe alguna restricción con Venezuela te recomiendo que pruebes con otro país si puedes. Saludos
@Pietti el problema seria la targeta de crediro de otro pais
@Alexander Rodriguez en este caso si te tocaría utilizar otro país y tarjeta de crédito, debido a las restricciones que existen actualmente. Saludos
venezuela no aparece como hago ?
Hola Daniel, con la configuración mostrada en el video es el costo por mes aproximadamente, hay configuraciones mas económicas desde 5 dolares mes. La prueba es por 12 meses o $300 Dolares, durante este tiempo o monto no se generara ningún cobro, todo aplicara como el crédito de la prueba que tienes. Saludos
@Pietti Gracias, un gran aporte para mi
Buenas y santas. Gracias por tu tiempo, además de lujo el video. Una consulta? .... los 14.20 (de wordpress para un solo dominio, vía Bitnami) eso si se abona verdad? Un saludo!!
A mi me interesa ese dato también. Quiero alojar varias web, y no sé que opción hay a buen precio.
Hola Jose, WordPress como tal siempre sera gratis, no obstante después del periodo de prueba gratis, los recursos que consumas serán cobrados recuerda que Google Cloud no existe una tarifa fija sino depende del consumo de recursos de la VM Instance, la IP estática y la zona DNS. Pero el valor principal estado por la configuración que tenga la instancia es decir, la memoria, el tipo y capacidad de disco. Saludos
@Pietti Muchas gracias.
Muy buen tutorial. Gracias. Una pregunta. ¿Las instalaciones de wordpress entran en la categoría &quot; Always Free&quot; cuando se termina la prueba gratuita? Entiendo que dependerá de la cantidad de recursos de Google Cloud que consuma el sitio, pero me refiero a la instalación de WP, IP´s y nombres de dominio que se puedan configurar con este sistema. Saludos
Buen vídeo amigo.
Hola Oswaldo, esta promoción solo aplica para los servicios de Google Cloud, no incluye el dominio. Saludos
Hola tengo una duda así como se te dan crédito y puedes pagar WordPress y tener certificado ssl puedo también comprar el dominio con el mismo crédito?
Hola como tal WordPress es un CMS gratis. Lo que pagas con el crédito o promoción es el servicio de Google Cloud, en este caso el hosting (VM Instance) para tener tu instalación de WordPress. Saludos
Tengo una pregunta, el wordpress es gratis? osea lo pago con los 300 usd gratuitos?
Hola Juan Pablo, si claro lo puedes hacer solo debes seguir los pasos para apuntar correctamente el dominio a Google Cloud. Saludos
Amigo si ya cuento con un dominio de Godaddy, puede aplicarlo a mi wordpress por ejemplo para crear una landing con Elementor ??
¿En cuanto tiempo te consumiste todos los créditos? quiero instalar Wordpress y Woocommerce pero no se si los créditos estén ligados a la cantidad de espacio consumido y termine bloqueandose el sitio Pietti ayudanos, Quiero hacer una prueba de Woocommerce con todo instalado usando un hosting gratuito, pero no he podido, en InfinityFree el servidor se cae el 94%, a veces veo que lo hacen a propósito para que te la pases en el Cpanel y les genere dinero por la publicidad que ellos anuncian. Use 000webhost y cuando te pasas del limite que ellos tiran un error de actualización que en realidad es bloqueo, ¿Alguien conoce una web para hacer pruebas?.
Hola Gonzalo, para activar Google Cloud después de finalizado el crédito o el periodo de prueba debes habilitar la facturación esta opción la encuentras en la sección Billing o Facturación. También podrías activarla y utilizar el plugin All In One WP Migration y crear una nueva cuenta para activar nuevamente el periodo gratuito, una vez hecho esto debes en la cuenta original borrar la VM Instance, el DNS y cualquier otro servicio. Saludos
Hola Rafael! Muchas gracias por tu tutorial, me sirvió muchísimo. Ya he consumido todo el crédito gratuito. Ahora no encuentro como activar la opción de pago para que mi web vuelva a estar activa. Dónde está esa opción?
Hola, en cada proyecto puedes instalar WordPress tantas veces lo necesites, puedes hacerlo creando para cada uno una nueva instancia, o también puedes tener en una sola instancia varias instalaciones de WordPress. Saludos
@Pietti muchas gracias por responder. me acabo de suscribir a tu canal, excelente.
Me encanta tu contenido, consulta¿cuántos sitios web puedo depositar en cada proyecto? o en cada proyecto tengo que instalar wordpress para otro sitio??
Hola Juan Carlos y ​ David Ga, los precios varían mucho y dependen de si el stack o imagen que van utilizar tiene algún costo o es gratis, pero el precio por lo general lo determina en gran medida la configuración que utilicemos para la instancia. Google Click to Deploy, WordPress Certified by Bitnami, y CyberPanel LiteSpeed Technologies-public (este tiene un control panel con OLS), el precio es similar y solo varia según la configuración que utilicemos. Recuerden que podemos dar click en el la aplicación que deseamos revisar del Marketplace y GCP nos mostrará entre otras cosas el valor estimado y más abajo nos dirá cómo se descompone este valor. Saludos
Hola Rafael, en cuanto a costo y dada que tengo pensado alojar varias paginas en google cloud, cual me recomiendas ya que hay wordpress bitmani multisite, wordpress click to deploy, otras que tienen la opcion de maquina virtual, incluso me parecio ver una de cpanel en el marketplace?
Hola Juan Carlos, te recomiendo ver este tutorial: <a href="https://www.onepagezen.com/google-cloud-ftp-filezilla-quick-start/">https://www.onepagezen.com/google-cloud-ftp-filezilla-quick-start/</a>. Saludos
Hola Rafael. Necesito usar filezilla para subir unos archivos traducidos a la pagina de wordpress. Donde consigo los datos de conecctión FTP. Tengo una mejor alternatova que fillezilla?
Segui tu tutorial y funciono! Tambien vi el de configurar el dominio. Ya tengo mi sitio en linea. MUY BUEN CONTENIDO! Felicidades!
Simplemente GRACIAS!!!
Hola Eduardo las líneas deben en aparecer en el archivo wp-config.php al cual accedes en esta versión mediante el comando &quot;sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/wp-config.php&quot; una vez en el archivo vas a buscar estas líneas, las cuales deben estar &quot;define(&#39;WP_SITEURL&#39;, &#39;http://&#39; . $_SERVER[&#39;HTTP_HOST&#39;] . &#39;/&#39;);<br />define(&#39;WP_HOME&#39;, &#39;http://&#39; . $_SERVER[&#39;HTTP_HOST&#39;] . &#39;/&#39;);&quot; están justo debajo de estas lineas &quot;if ( defined( &#39;WP_CLI&#39; ) ) {<br /> $_SERVER[&#39;HTTP_HOST&#39;] = &#39;localhost&#39;;<br />}&quot;. Ahí procedes a cambiar la URL por la de tu dominio, o simplemente puedes agregar al &quot;http://&quot; la s y quedaría asi &quot;https://&quot; y dejas lo otro tal cual, recuerda si agregas la s es por que vas a instalar el certificado SSL como mostramos en este video: <a href="https://youtu.be/1KGiAMUCG8o">https://youtu.be/1KGiAMUCG8o</a>. Saludos
@Pietti Podría enviarte captura de pantalla a algún correo para mostrarte lo que aparece en mi wp config.php? no está WP_SITE URL ni WP_HOME, tampoco está defined &quot;WP_CLI&quot;
@Pietti Muchísimas gracias Rafael, ya te lo acabo de enviar.
@Eduardo Diz según lo que me enviaste primero el archivo no es wp-admin.php sino wp-config.php, lo segundo que veo es que la versión que instalaste es la versión Multisite de WordPress Bitnami, quieres tener una instalacion Multisitio o no?. Sino es así debes iniciar el proceso nuevamente y borrar la VM instancia anterior. Si es para multisitio este paso no aplica de la misma forma. Saludos
@Eduardo Diz te acabo de responder por aquí. Saludos
@Pietti Muchísimas gracias Rafael. Realmente no se como fue que instalé el multisitio, aunque en verdad me interesaría utilizarlo si pudiera saber como subir las dns ya que tengo tres dominios, uno que quisiera migrar de otro host y dos dominios vacios (uno es por el que estoy intentando comenzar). Si hubiera alguna forma simple para completar este último paso de agregar las dns en el wp-config.php que tu sepas te lo agradecería enormemente, caso contrario desinstalo el multisitio e instalo la versión que indicas en tu tutorial.
@Eduardo Diz creo que la solución mas recomendable para ti es que utilices la version normal, es importante que no tenga la palabra Multisitio o Multisite, próximamente estaré montando nuevos videos dentro de esos estará uno de multisitios. Saludos
@Pietti Voy a hacer eso así puedo aprovechar todos tus tutoriales. Ya estoy suscripto, realmente valoro tus videos, sin ellos sería imposible llevar esto a cabo.
@Pietti Buenas tardes Rafael, ya pude hacer el tutorial de delegación de las dns. Lo que no recuerdo es donde encuentro mis claves de admin del wordpress bitnami. Me podrás orientar?.
@PiettiYa pude encontrar las claves, no es que no sean las correctas. Será que todavía no se completó la delegación de las dns y por esto no puedo ingresar?. Ya quedaría sustituida la dirección web original por la que delegué, es decir el ingreso debería ser en <a href="http://www.abogadocaba.com.ar/wp-admin.php">http://www.abogadocaba.com.ar/wp-admin.php</a> y ya no <a href="http://35.247.254.123/wp-admin">http://35.247.254.123/wp-admin</a>, correcto?. Será cuestión de esperar, lo hice hace menos de una hora, no se lo que puede demorar. tenía entendido que puede que hasta 48hs en Argentina que es donde me encuentro.
@Pietti sale eso en error al acceder al sitio web DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN
@Eduardo Diz la clave la encuentras haciendo click en VM Instance ahí te aparecerá una clave que es la que debes utilizar, por defecto el usuario es &quot;user&quot;, te recuerdo que por seguridad debes crear un nuevo usuario administrador y clave, y borrar el usuario por defecto de WordPress que fue creado. Saludos
@Eduardo Diz es usuario es &quot;user&quot; y la clave que te muestra en la instancia. Puedes probar haciendo un ping al dominio a ver que IP te aparece, puedes utilizar la consola de Windows para hacerlo, tecla de Windows + r, después &quot;cmd&quot; y luego haces ping a tu dominio mediante &quot;ping <a href="http://dominio.com/">dominio.com</a>&quot; y te van aparecer la IP asociada y ahí confirmas que este apuntando correctamente a los servidores de Google Cloud. En linea también puedes utilizar esta herramienta: <a href="https://www.dnsqueries.com/es/consulta_servidor_dns.php">https://www.dnsqueries.com/es/consulta_servidor_dns.php</a> y en tipo colocas all. Saludos
@Pietti era cuestión de esperar una hora. Muchísimas gracias por todo Rafael. Ya pude entrar.
@Eduardo Diz debes esperar la propagación de DNS. Saludos
@Eduardo Diz ya revise y el dominio si esta apuntando a los servidores de Google y la IP, pero debes comprobar que los registros DNS estén correctos sobre todo el registro A y CNAME. Saludos
Primeramente agradecerte toda la ayuda que prestas con estos tutoriales. Logré llegar hasta el momento de tener que colocar define(&#39;WP_SITEURL&#39;, &#39;http://&#39; . $_SERVER[&#39;HTTP_HOST&#39;] . &#39;/&#39;);
 <br />define(&#39;WP_HOME&#39;, &#39;http://&#39; . $_SERVER[&#39;HTTP_HOST&#39;] . &#39;/&#39;);. Instalé la versión actual que es Wordpress certified by bitnami and automatic, será por eso que no encuentro estas lineas?.Después de FS METHOD viene directamente ABBSPATH, es decir, no está &quot;WP CLI&quot; ni tampoco SITE URL ni WP_HOME. Será conveniente copiar todas las líneas que aparecen en el código que se ve en tu video?, o que me recomiendas hacer?. Muchísimas gracias desde ya.
Hola Eduardo, si es el mismo solo que ahora la instalación viene con plugins de Automatic, que puedes borrar después de instalado. El costo depende de la configuración de la VM Instancia. Pero si estas utilizando el crédito de un año gratis o $300 dolares te sirve para un año completo. Saludos
Muchísimas gracias Rafael!
No pude encontrar exactamente el mismo wordpress certified by bitnami, el que pude encontrar dice &quot;WordPress Certified by Bitnami and Automattic&quot; será lo mismo?. El monto aproximado es de U$$ 22 al mes aproximado.
Eduardo este error significa que creaste más interfaces que el máximo admitido por el tipo de máquina de tu instancia, revisa esta documentación de Google: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/create-use-multiple-interfaces?hl=es-419#troubleshooting">https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/create-use-multiple-interfaces?hl=es-419#troubleshooting</a>. Saludos
Has alcanzado el número máximo de una interfaz de red, me sale ese aviso, que error cometí?
Hola Oscar al momento el máximo de banda de Google Cloud es de 100 Gb/s y hasta con dos circuitos. Pero como tal no existe un máximo o limite para tu instancia en cuanto a consumo de banda ancha. La maquina virtual VM Instance, la tendrás que configurar dependiendo del trafico de tu sitio web, y es ahí donde veras diferencias de precios. Saludos
Hola, muy buen vídeo, tengo una duda, generalmente en los hosting web de pago vienen unas tasas o limites de ancho de banda...cuánto sería este ancho de banda con la interfaz gratis de Google Cloud?
Hola Fernanda si es posible migrar WordPress a Google Cloud, te recomiendo ver este video donde te explico como hacerlo <a href="https://youtu.be/RnMpc5ofOm0.Saludos">https://youtu.be/RnMpc5ofOm0.Saludos</a>
@Pietti muchas gracias tu vídeo fue de gran ayuda.
Saludos, yo deseo migrar mi dominio de godaddy a google cloud, pero mi wordpress es administrado, es posible migrar mi wordpress también a google cloud? no he encontrado mucha información al respecto. Espero puedas ayudarme...
Hola puedes también utilizar una cuenta de gmail, si es para activar la prueba gratis el único requisito es que no se haya utilizado antes la cuenta para activar la prueba gratis de GCP. Saludos
Saludos una pregusta por que tiene que ser una cuenta coorporativa y no una de gmail ?
muy buen tutorial! en el video dices que la información del despliegue la podremos modificar más adelante. ¿Donde se accede a esta modificación?
Gracias
¡Muy buen vídeo! Muchas gracias por el aporte
Hola Oscar, en este caso con el mismo dominio te recomiendo que instales la version Multisite de WordPress, el proceso es un poco diferente. Puedes encontrar documentación oficial en Bitnami. Saludos.
Puedo tener los dos? y si vale le agradecería que haga un tutorial de como instalar correctamente gracias saludos
@Oscar Almeida en la misma instancia no, deberás tenerlo en instancias separadas. Saludos
buenos dias puedo crear mas de una pagina web en wordpress con google cloud binami? deseo hacer 10 paginas web con el mismo dominio por favor me puedes ayudar con una explicacion a esto gracias
Hola Oscar, debes seguir el proceso, reservar la IP estática y luego debes crear la zona DNS los registros A y CNAME, después de haber hecho esto debes colocar los nombres de servidores en donde registraste el dominio son 4 Nameservers. Recuerda que la propagación de DNS puede tomar algún tiempo y depende del proveedor de dominios. Saludos
BUENOS DIAS una pregunta segui todo al pie de la letra optube un dominio con freedom y le quiero enlasar con mi ip que me da wordpress pero no se conecta cuando carga la pagina me sale solo el ip alguna solucion al respecto? gracias mil gracias
Hola Oscar, que errores estas presentando actualmente?
Buenos días le cuento que por mas que e seguido el proceso no doy con los errores no se si ud me pueda ayudar a configurarla por que no doy con el error tal vez le pueda dar mi usuario y me pueda dar configurando ud por que la verdad estoy estancado y no se que mas hacer espero me pueda ayudar gracias.
Hola Julio, debes habilitar el DNS en Google Cloud, después de que hayas colocado la IP estática de Google Cloud, vas a crear los registros A y CNAME, después de esto los Nameservers NS los vas a colocar en donde tengas tu dominio. Ya los registros MX, TXT u otros dependerán de tus configuraciones particulares. Saludos
no tengo ns en mi los dominios dns de mi cuenta, tengo A, AAAA, CNAME, LOC, MX, NAPTR, RP, TXT , CUAL USO?
Hola Julio, puedes editar tu theme de WordPress ya sea desde apariencia, por ftp o por actualización del theme de WordPress sin ningún problema. Saludos
@Pietti gracias pero por ftp esta en gcp, ya que lo hice como tu tutorial, pero no puedo ver los archvis de wp, asi lo edito y lo subo a mi capeta me podes explicar?
@Pietti te explico, tengo mi tema, pero no me gusta nada quiero editarlo con bootstrap para luego convertir la web en amp y pwa, pero todo lo quiero hacer por codigo y limpio, se podra hacer eso? el tema es que lei la docuemntacion de bitnami y no entiendo como puedo subir y editar mis archivos wp en gcp, osea vi tutoriales en yt, pero yo uso una macbook, y cambia un poco, ya que en windows se usa putty pero en mac no es necesario porque se puede controlar todo por ssh desde la terminal. La idea que quiero llevar a cabo se puede, te la pusisite a pensar?
@julio fleitas puedes ver este tutorial donde se explica como conectarse por FTP: <a href="https://onepagezen.com/google-cloud-ftp-filezilla-quick-start/">https://onepagezen.com/google-cloud-ftp-filezilla-quick-start/</a>. Saludos
hola, como puedo editar le proyecto de wordpress osea quiero editar mi template de wp desde el instalador de wp, esto se puede? osea quiero cargar mi template en wp, esto lo tengo que hacer desde gcp? desde ya mychas gracias
@Pietti los 22$ ya descuentan de los 300$ que nos regalan ??
@Carlos Caceres Tengo la misma duda. Por favor aclaranos eso.
Hola Brayan, puedes elegir cualquier despliegue de WordPress estos tutoriales fueron hechos con la version Bitnami. El costo depende de la configuración de tu VM Instance, pero el valor mínimo son como 5 Dolares Mensuales. Saludos
porque se elige la bietnami? y luego del año cuanto se debe pegar en total?
Hola Luis, si puedes alojar varias bases de datos debes ingresar por phpMyAdmin. Te recomiendo este tutorial te puede servir: <a href="https://onepagezen.com/phpmyadmin-ssh-tunnel/">https://onepagezen.com/phpmyadmin-ssh-tunnel/</a>. Saludos
Hola. Muchas gracias por el vídeo, muy claro. Una pregunta: como se hace para alojar una base de datos, si requiero alojar varias bases, se puede? Muchas gracias
Hola Marcell, puedes ingresar mediante tu <a href="http://dominio.com/wp-admin/">dominio.com/wp-admin/</a>. Saludos
Si, eso lo sé, gracias, el tema es que cuando quiero ingresar sale lo siguiente: iniciar-session-login__trashed/ ahí el detalle
@Marcell Robles puedes compartir el link de tu sitio web para revisar. Saludos
@Pietti Claro que si, <a href="http://amb-lp.online/">amb-lp.online</a> Muchas gracias.
​@Marcell Robles tienes una redirección a una pagina, la solución para esto seria desactivar esta dirección mediante la desactivación del plugin que lo haga momentáneamente. Puedes hacerlo por SSH renombrado los plugins que este afectando esta redirección mediante el comando &quot;sudo mv /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/wp-content/plugins/nombredelpluginmodifcado/&quot;. Otra alternativa es hacerlo mediante la phpMyAdmin para esto te recomiendo ver este link: <a href="https://onepagezen.com/phpmyadmin-ssh-tunnel/">https://onepagezen.com/phpmyadmin-ssh-tunnel/</a> y este link para desactivar los plugins: <a href="https://help.one.com/hc/es/articles/115005593985-Desactivar-los-plugins-de-WordPress-en-phpMyAdmin">https://help.one.com/hc/es/articles/115005593985-Desactivar-los-plugins-de-WordPress-en-phpMyAdmin</a>.

Muy buen tutorial, salió de fábula. Una consulta, luego de elaborar páginas con Elementor, no me gustó el resultado final de algunas páginas, decidí borrarlas, pero, cometí el error de eliminar la página que me permite el ingreso (login) al panel de Wordpress, ahora no sé como ingresar para hacer mis modificaciones. Tal vez, puedas darme una ayudita con esto. Gracias y nuevamente, buen video.

Hola tienes algun tutorial acerca del google cloud como hosting y que tan recomendable es ? Muchas gracias
Hola Adrian, en Bitnami el usuario es user y la clave la encuentras haciendo clic en tu VM Instance y aparece en donde dice &quot;bitnami-base-password&quot;. Saludos
Cual es el usuario y el password que se instala por defecto?
Hola, puedes crear tantas cuentas como necesites ahora recuerda que cada VM Instance creada genera un costo, mi commendation es que crees proyectos por dominios así los puedes tener mas organizados. Saludos
¿cuantos dominios puedo alojar en una misma cuenta de Google cloud? en mi caso ya tengo una pagina web creada y alojada en cloud; será que puedo crear otra web con un dominio distinto, configurarla al igual que la primera para que tenga WordPress con bitnami, sin afectar la primera pagina que tengo ya creada o debería hacer otra cuenta de Google cloud para el nuevo proyecto. Saludos!
Hola el proceso es similar en la instalación pero debes utilizar el stack WordPress Multisite. El certificado SSL hay algunas variaciones. Saludos
Hola Rafael, excelente tutorial. Sirve también para multisitio?
Hola Fernando, que no te funciono? Saludos
@Pietti gracias, configure los ns en el dominio y en el SSH del cloud cambien las linas por la url del dominio.... Al momento de ingresar no me hace el cambio de la ip por el nombre...... No se que puede ser......
cordial saludo, estoy realizando el proceso de montar una pagina web EDUCATIVA en google cloud, segui los pasos pero no me funciona. podrias ayudarme?
Oye felicitaciones, que buen tutorial<br />🔴 De casualidad alguien sabe como quitar el &quot;manage&quot; que aparece en la parte inferior derecha de la página?<br /><br />De antemano muchas gracias
Hola Diego revisa este video donde esta el truco para quitarlo: <a href="https://youtu.be/iWRT9Rcm6eg">https://youtu.be/iWRT9Rcm6eg</a>. Saludos
👍 Excelente tutorial.<br />🔴 Pregunta: Como quitar el logo de Bitnami cuando la página está al aire?<br />Muchas gracias
@Pietti Como seria eso ? Donde se configura!! Please
Hola Nick debes hacerlo mediante SMTP. Saludos
Excelente tutorial. <br />Pregunta: Alguna forma para activar la opción de enviar correos desde un formulario? ya que me indica que no esta configurado para enviar correo.
Hola, como tal la configuración utilizada para la VM Instance utilizada en este tutorial puede servirte para varios dominios y subdominios dependiendo del trafico de los mismos, sin embargo este stack de Bitnami WordPress esta pensado para un solo dominio, deberías buscar otra alternativa en el Marketplace o instalar todo manualmente. Saludos
@Pietti Vale!!! Mil gracias, eres una Campeon!!!
Hola!!! Muchas gracias por toda la info. tan precisa!!! Quiero preguntarte algo: Para cuantos dominios y la vez subdominios puede soportar esto? puedo tener varios dominios allí con esa misma configuración? Gracias!!!
Hola Mariano, bitnami es un stack que para este caso es de WordPress, y simplemente usamos este a manera de ejemplo en el tutorial y por su facilidad y confiabilidad. Saludos
Hola, que es bitnami y por que entre todas las opciones del marketplace seleccionas esa ?
Hola Pepe son similares no existe mayor diferencia entre Bitnami o Google Click to Deploy, varían algunos comandos a la hora de instalar certificados, agregar expires headers etc. Saludos
Hola buena tarde que diferencia hay entre la versión de WordPress con bitnami y la versión que aparece de un solo click????

Hola Muchas gracias, una pregunta, como puedo administrar los archivos del servidor por medio de BitVise o Filezilla?
Hola Sebastian, una de las grandes ventajas de estos servicios es su capacidad para escalar de acuerdo a las necesidades de tu proyecto sin tener que realizar migraciones u otros procesos, la AI de Google Cloud te mostrara si tu proyecto requiere mas capacidad o esta subutilizando la capacidad instalada para que así saques el mejor provecho de tu sitio web. Referente Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure y Google Cloud, todos son servicios similares, el que tiene hasta ahora mayor porción del mercado es Amazon pero cada ves mas Azure y Google Cloud ganan una mayor cuota de mercado. Personalmente prefiero GCP por su interfaz, soporte y experiencia. Saludos
Hola. Gracias por tu vídeo increíble la verdad. Tengo algunas dudas y me gustaría que me apoyaran a resolverlas. Tenia mi tienda en linea de moda en Shopify pero me cambiare a WooCommerce por la personalización de la misma, mi duda es sobre Google Cloud Platform, que tal va de rendimiento y de personas que me puedan visitar al mes? Lo que busco es que por ejemplo si un año tengo 45 mil vistas mensuales y al otro año 2 o 3 millones de vistas al mes el servidor pueda soportar, obvio se que pagare mas y no importa mientras funcione esta bien. ¿Eso se puede con GCP? Solo escalar los recursos y listo, sin tener que instalar de nuevo la tienda en otro lado o así. ¿Que es mejor para esto Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure o Google Cloud Platform? Gracias aprecio su tiempo. :)
Hola si es posible migrar a otro hosting o servidor cuando se termine el año o antes, en este video te explicamos como: <a href="https://youtu.be/RnMpc5ofOm0">https://youtu.be/RnMpc5ofOm0</a>. Saludos
@Pietti Muchas gracias
Si uso Google Cloud durante el primer año, compro un dominio y me asocio, ¿puedo transferir todo el sitio después del primer año?
Hola
 <br />Quería saber después de un año, si quiero transferir el sitio web a otro hosting, es posible?
 <br />gracias
Hola al momento de escribir este comentario te puedo asegurar que no hacen ningún cobro durante el periodo de prueba que consiste en un crédito de $300 dolares o 12 meses gratis lo que se cumpla primero para una cuenta nueva en Google Cloud. Saludos
@Pietti si durante el periodo no pero después de que te pasas porque te olvidas o no ves el email como le pasó a mi amiga te pasaste del periodo de prueba y te cobran
Lo mismo dijieron con la prueba gratis de YouTube y a una amiga le cobraron

Rafael muy bien explicado todo, pero tengo un problema, podrías ayudarme? Tengo mi sitio alojado en google cloud, funcionando con mi dominio de nominalia, pero es incapaz de enviar correos desde mi dominio y por lo tanto tampoco funciona el envío de formularios. Consulté a Nominalia y respondieron que como mi dominio apunta a Google no se puede configurar los mx ni las cuentas de correo en nominalia, sino que debo hacerlo en google, he estado buscando información pero no encuentro nada ni se como hacerlo. Muchas gracias
Excelente! Excelente Excelente
Hola Felix, para este caso te recomendaría utilizar LAMP Click-to-Deploy, ya que este stack de Bitnami WordPress esta diseñado para una sola instalación de WordPress en una VM Instance. Próximamente estaremos lanzando un curso que te puede servir para realizar de manera fácil la configuración de multiples dominios e instalaciones de WordPress. Saludos
Saludos muy buen tutorial, ¿y si quiero instalar varias paginas de Wordpress, osea varios sitios?
Hola Pablo, si claro que los puedes tener apuntando a la misma instancia u otra diferente. Saludos
@Pietti gracias pero no entiendo como se configurar <a href="http://www.misubdominio.misitio.com/">www.MiSubDominio.Misitio.com</a> ??
@Pablo Gomez si lo quieres apuntar a otra instancia lo haces mediante una zona DNS el registro A apunta a la nueva IP de la otra instancia, y el CNAME incluye el subdominio al crearlo. Si quieres que sea a la misma instancia lo puedes hacer mediante la configuración del subdominio en Apache VirtualHost, en una instalación LAMP. Saludos
excelentes videos muchas gracias una pregunta como se pueden hacer sub dominios ???
Hola Pablo por defecto en Google Cloud, debes enviar el correo por SMTP, ya en otra respuesta te amplié sobre este tema. Saludos
Hola Excelente Video Muchas Gracias por compartir ¡¡¡ tengo un problema desde mi sitio de wordpress no envía los email por las compras efectuadas revise las configuraciones de WooCommerce pero estas bien el email ???
Hola, para este numero la instancia deberías al menos tener 8vCPU y 32GB en RAM (AMD EPYC Rome CPU platform o Intel Cascade Lake CPU platform), podrías configurar un Swapfile que te respalde la memoria, para reducir la latencia podrías utilizar el Load Balancer y Google Cloud CDN. Ahora si tu aplicación el trafico no es constante y puede presentar picos creo que la mejor solución seria utilizar Google Cloud Run. Si puedes comparte que solución te sirvió mejor para desplegar tu aplicación. Saludos
Pietti muchas gracias por responder tienes algún Tutorial de Google cloud run y de load balancer o conoces donde puedo encontrar un video tutorial de esto por favor 🙏?
Estimado Rafael una consulta que capacidad de maquinal virtual se nescita para 10.000 espectadores simultaneos que visiten la pagina en una trasmision de evento es nesesario un balanceador de carga ? o cloud flare para que soporte esa cantidad de visitantes ?<br />Ayuda por favor

Hola. muchas gracias por tan excelentes tutotriales. Si quisiese crear un proyecto nuevo, sin duda alguna tu tutorial sería perfecto porque explicas de lujo. Pero mi caso es tengo mi pagina ya creada. Alojada en un hosting de pago. También la tengo en mi pc con servidor local XAMPP. Mi pregunta es, como puedo subir los archivos de mi pagina, que ya tengo desarrollada. Como ingreso aquí al PHPMyAdmin? Donde veo mis bases de datos???
Segui tu sugerencia pero sigue sin poder accesar
Gracias ♥
Estoy super agradecido con tus videos tan claros Rafael. Un millón de gracias.
Excelente tutorial Rafael. Si alguien tiene problemas con el password temporal de Bitnami (login user y un password temporal que aparentemente no sirve para entrar a la consola de admin de wordpress, es porque cuando le das click al link que te da google cloud para entrar al panel de admin directamente lleva basura en el url. solo copia el url sin darle click y ponlo directamente en la barra de direcciones del navegador y asi funciona todo sin problemas. Una vez mas mil gracias Rafael.
Hola Fiorella, para Peru podría ser us-east-1b o en el data center en Brazil, sin embargo revisa los costos el servicio en Brazil es mas costoso. Saludos
@Pietti Gracias, como había opción southamerica también, me maree

Hola Dyego, si es posible pero debes instalar una Version LAMP y configurar los distintos sitios que quieres tener utilizando una sola instancia o maquina virtual en este curso explicamos como hacerlo: <a href="https://pietti.com/curso/wordpress-google-cloud/">https://pietti.com/curso/wordpress-google-cloud/</a>. Saludos
Con este hosting gratis de Google Cloud, es posible cargar varios sitios web hechos con wordpress en este mismo hosting?
Hola Dyego, simplemente le das ignorar y listo. Saludos
Hola, utilice el hosting de Google Cloud y cree una pagina de WordPress con Bitnami, pero al ingresar a la pagina http://xx.xx.x.xx//wp-admin/ me sale el mensaje (con el candado y una raya roja) &quot;Esta conexion no es segura. Las credenciales introducidas pueden verse comprometidas&quot; Como puedo solucionar eso? para poder ingresar
Hola Patricode, lo estas comparando con un share hosting, cuando lo debes comparar con VPS, cuando lo comparas con un VPS te darás cuenta que inclusive el precio es menor en Google, este es un ejemplo de como instalar WordPress con Bitnami, sin embargo podrías instalar un LAMP Server y tener tantos sitios como quieras en una sola instancia. Te invito a probarlo no te va costar nada y te darás cuenta que la velocidad es superior. Saludos
a 14 dolares solo el wordpress me parece muy caro ,en el hosting que tengo solo pago 3.5 dolares por mes y tengo sitios ilimitados.
Hola abre la dirección IP seguida de /wp-admin en una ventana de incognito o escribe manualmente y pruebas, al parecer el link que proporciona en la instalación agrega cosas que impiden el acceso. Saludos
@Pietti me funcionó, gracias :)
cuando clikeo en wp-admin me aparece aviso de redireccionamiento y después no me carga nada cuando digito el user y contraseña ¿Qué podrá ser?
Muchas gracias tienes contenido muy valioso.
Hola Bitnami no te va cobrar nada extra. Saludos
@Pietti gracias 🤗
Me ayudan por favor, como es eso de que bitnami me va a cobrar extra o como ?
Hola Sergio depende de la configuración de tu instancia y los servicios que estés utilizando, normalmente comienza en 5 Dólares mensuales aproximadamente. Ahora existen unos recursos que son siempre gratis y que te permiten tener tu sitio web sin generar costos. Saludos
cuàndo acaba el año de prueba, ¿de cuànto es la tarifa?
Hola Jose, después de los 90 días debes habilitar la facturación para continuar con los servicios. Saludos
@Pietti Hay alguna forma de utilizar los recursos gratuitos para hacer un blog básico informativo de una sola pagina? Gracias por el contenido Rafael!!
@Jose Sandino si hay una configuración en particular que te permite tener siempre los recursos gratis. Google Cloud Free Tier: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free">https://cloud.google.com/free</a>. En este curso explicamos el método: <a href="https://pietti.com/curso/wordpress-google-cloud/">https://pietti.com/curso/wordpress-google-cloud/</a>. Saludos
Que pasa despues de los 90 dias? te comienzan a cobrar?
Hola Felipe, el costo en gran medida depende de la configuración de cada maquina virtual que tengas en Google Cloud, podrías tener en un solo proyecto todas los sitios web que necesites mediante una instalación LAMP por ejemplo y así seria menos costoso y mas fácil su administración. Te recomiendo que mires este Curso de WordPress Google Cloud: <a href="https://pietti.com/curso/wordpress-google-cloud/">https://pietti.com/curso/wordpress-google-cloud/</a>. Saludos
@Pietti Me podrías guiar un poco sobre alojar varios sitios web en una maquina virtual? Gracias por tu respuesta
tengo una duda, si tengo varios sitios web alojados en google cloud y cada uno es un proyecto separado, el coste será por cada sitio el valor que establece la plataforma? o dependerá del trafico y consumo que tenga esa web el cobro que te harán? gracias por tus videos.
y pasando ese año que pasa ? ya no tendras el acceso o servicio de WordPress ? y entonces tienes que pagar si o si esos minimos 4 dolares ?<br /><br />Excelente VIDEO
Hola Francisco en este momento ya no aplica un año, la promoción ahora es de 300 dólares o 90 días lo que se cumpla primero, puedes crear después de este tiempo otra prueba con otro correo. Existe también una configuración en la que es gratis totalmente mediante Google Free Tier. Saludos
Cómo podría ser totalmente gratuita. Sería bueno para proyectos personales pequeños, cierto?
pero pasando el año.-- ya no nos daran 300 creditos de nuevo ? y entonces si o si tendriamos que pagar ?
Hola Alex, puedes hacer lo mismo, simplemente es mas facil de instalar y viene configurado ya para GCP. Trae instalado unos plugins por defecto pero si nos los necesitas los puedes desinstalar sin problema. Saludos
Gracias por contestar es que quiero hacer una página web para educación a distancia
Tu sabes por el COVlD19
@capcioso te recomiendo que utilices Bitnami, es mas fácil y rápido de instalar y WordPress es el mismo. Saludos
@Pietti muchas gracias cuidate
Disculpa el dominio es ,con o .edu es para educación a distancia sin ánimo de lucro y otra duda más escojo en el tipo de máquina small de 1,7 o 1 vCPU DE 3,75 o voy a necesitar hacer uso del crédito de los 300 dólares Para compras futuras de plugins?
@capcioso puedes comenzar por la small y después ir subiéndola a medida que el proyecto lo requiera, recuerda que a mayores recursos el costo del servicio aumentara. El saldo de los $300 dolares o 12 Meses gratis lo que primero ocurra son para utilizarlos en Google Cloud Platform no en otro sitio. Saludos
@Pietti te agradezco cuidate
@Pietti disculpa cuando compro dominio en godaddy me pone la opción de privacidad de dominio es necesario que lo compre o con el certificado SSL es suficiente?
@capcioso la privacidad de dominio se refiere a Who Is, para que sean privados los datos de quien compro el dominio y no tiene nada que ver con el certificado SSL, normalmente no es necesario adquirir este servicio de privacidad de dominio. Saludos
Con Wordpress bitnami puedo hacer lo mismo que con el Wordpress normal o está enfocado para negocios? O mejor en google floyd puedo instalar el Wordpress normal siguiendo este tutorial?
Hola Pietti, tengo un sitio en google cloud y ya va a terminar el año de prueba, que host gratuito me recomiendas para exportarlo?. Gracias Saludos

I think Ferrero has migrated to AWS now, and using AWS S3 storage and other PaaS of AWS
Thank you! Cheers!
Good one
In GCP in demand in 2021 but???????????<br />Isn&#39;t AWS easier? ?? <br />Please advise
got amazed , after seeing google cloud platform
Great talk. Having only knowledge of the AWS this was a great talk to show the main tools that one use but on GCP.
Thanks David! :)
Fantastic! Thanks for this tutorial
Great intro to Cloud Computing. I really like the way you simplify the process of choosing what&#39;s best depending on some scenarios. Thanks!
Excellent. I really like your slide about GCP.
At least it&#39;s not a canned demo. We devs totally understand these hiccups.
I love the honesty here. Anyone who has done a demo (especially one that is network dependent) has been in his shoes.<br />The intro was concise and easy to process. I highly recommend the full keynote session as there are some extremely interesting moves that GCP is making this year.
Are these slides made with Google Slides?
SOLID overview. Thanks for publishing this!
Great overview. The hiccups made it authentic and enjoyable to watch.
Amazing ... but they &quot;forgot&quot; to mention the NSA-access point ordered by top secret court rulings ... ! ... <br /> ... or is this not a security feature? ... ;-)
Scott Mc. Nealy from Sun Microsystems Inc. once promoted beginning of the 1990ths SUN&#39;s vision &quot;The Network is the Computer!&quot; ... well ... as so often with real visions ... it took nearly 3 decades ... and it&#39;s nowadays not the business of SUN anymore ... ;-)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmOMataJZWw&amp;t=41m20s">41:20</a> The &quot;face covered&quot; API algorithm for AI didn&#39;t aged well XD
Glad to hear it!
@Google Cloud Tech it would be great if you could share the twitter handle/ or whichever platform they are happy to connect on of the speakers (on the description). I think this should be present in most if not all of the presentation videos. <br />Just a suggestion.<br /><br />P.S: Thank you for sharing this :)
After going through hell lot of videos this is the most helpful for someone looking to get started on GCP. Thanks Terrance, great job !!!
Help full
Please help me
Please help me
@Apuntes IT me pide que mande foto de mi dni y tarjeta que hago
Si se me acaban los 90 días me puedo crear otra cuenta ?
@Apuntes IT y tengo que cambiar la tarjeta de crédito?
@Apuntes IT muchas gracias por responder,te hablo desde España yo como puedo ponerme en argentina para que no me pidna eso
Hey buddy! Credit card is needed. But, you can get a virtual card. You may register on <a href="https://www.somosmach.com/">https://www.somosmach.com/</a> You must to put some money for active the card and all set!<br />Happy nerd!
Can i have one ,i don&#39;t have a credit card
xD xD xD
Hola, por el momento no me figuró ningun gasto en la tarjeta. Se supone que no se cobra nada a menos que sobrepases las características y caduque la promoción de los u$s300 o los 90 días.<br />Si tengo algún gasto lo comento en estos comentarios.<br />Gracias por comentar.
tienes que confirmar la tarjeta con el monto que te llega? porque antes pasaba eso no se si nay que confirmar aun?
@Apuntes IT pero hay dice 300 dolares de credito y 90 dias de servicios gratuitos, no es para siempre se vence la suscripcion obviamente se para la vps..
Según las políticas actuales de Google y cumpliendo con los requerimientos indicados, es de por vida. O por lo menos hasta que Google cambie los términos y condiciones del servicio.<br />Saludos.
@Apuntes ITgracias ya hice todo lo del vídeo ahora para comenzar a usarlo que hago ?
@CRISTIANDAD MUSIC Debes instalar un entorno LAMP y luego crear tu sitio web como lo desees. Estoy preparando el nuevo video donde se muestra la instalación de LAMP y un wordpress. Supongo que lo tendré listo para este fin de semana.
@Apuntes IT vale gracias espero tu vídeo
@Nau Hola! Si prestas atención en el video indico que esta configuración, la que se indica en el video, se respetan todas las características para poder usar el VPS en modo gratuito hasta que algún día Google cambie las políticas. Para un ejemplo mejor, si estas mismas características las utilizas en una zona diferente a las indicas vas a tener un costo. El crédito es como dices tu y como se indica en el video. Pero si prestas atención, ese crédito no está activado aún, así que tampoco está siendo utilizado hasta que se active manualmente. De todos modos va en tí si quieres utilizar esto o no, conociendo todas las limitaciones que tiene algo gratis. O puedes utilizarlo hasta gastar el crédito y luego eliges que quieres hacer.<br />Gracias por tus comentarios. Saludos.
Cuanto tiempo dura el VPS gratuito?
Hola, en principio te sirve para hacer lo que quieras. Lo que debes tener en cuenta es que es un servidor muy pequeño en recursos y si tienes muchos visitantes simultáneos la respuesta del sitio va a ser muy lenta o puede que no responda a tantas peticiones. También debes tener en cuenta la capacidad de datos, tienes solamente 30 GB de los cuales el sistema te va a consumir unos 8GB seguramente. Creo que si tu idea es montar una tienda no es la mejor opción y debas pensar en invertir algo de dinero en un servidor que cumpla con tus necesidades.<br />Saludos.
Se puede usar para el trading?
Gracias por la recomendación. En breve subiré un video donde muestro como tener un VPS gratis en la nube de Oracle. Suscribite al canal y activá la campanita si es que no lo hiciste para que te avise cuando esté publicado. Saludos!
Si interesante<br /><br /><br />Otras opciones de servidores gratuitos
Hola! Sí, debes hacer los mismos pasos ya que todo el registro y el acceso a la plataforma de Google la realizar por el navegador web que utiices. Luego, los comando de configuración para el VPS son los que se indican en cada caso ya que se utiliza una distribución Linux.<br />Saludos!
Hola saludos! Para trabajar con Windows? Tengo que hacer los mismos pasos que haces en el video? Gracias por el video
Hola! Esta máquina gratuita te entrega 640MB de RAM. Pero si pagas la plataforma te puede entregar la cantidad que necesites. Saludos.
hola cuanto te dan de ram
Hola! lamentablemente debes utilizar una tarjeta de crédito o débito. Esto es para que puedan asegurar un cobro si es que se debe cobrar algo en el período utilizado. En la cadena de comentarios de este mismo video respondí a otro compañero una posibilidad de utilizar una tarjeta de crédito virtual. Espero haber respondido a tus dudas, si es así te pido que me apoyes con tu suscripción al canal.<br />Saludos!
Buenas noches ,saludos en Venezuela nos tienen bloqueados y no tenemos tarjetas en dólares , podríamos usar Paypal o Airtm
Hola! Lamentablemente no hay manera de poder darte de alta sin una tarjeta de crédito o débito. Deberías pedir prestada alguna tarjeta para poder darte de alta o esperar a que alguna fintech o empresa financiera saque algún programa de tarjetas de crédito virtuales. Por ejemplo, en Chile hay un banco que ofrece esto y lo único que debes hacer es tener crédito cargado en la tarjeta virtual al momento de darte de alta en el sistema. Espero haberte ayudado de algún modo. Si es así te pido que me apoyes con tu suscrpción si es que no lo hiciste. Saludos.
@Apuntes IT amigo me podria ayudar con una cuenta, no tengo tarjeta de credito, yo le podria pagar a ud por paypal por la ayuda
Hay alguna manera de registrarse para los miserables que no tenemos tarjeta de credito?
Hola! el editor que utilizo en el video es el vim y para poder guardar los cambios debe salir del modo edición presionando la tecla &quot;Esc&quot; y luego las teclas &quot;:&quot; + &quot;w&quot; + &quot;q&quot; <br />Espero que te sea de ayuda. Si es así te pido que apoyes al canal con tu suscripción si es que no lo hiciste y actives la campanita para que te enteres de los nuevos videos que estoy por subir. Gracias por acompañarme.
como hago para guardar la edición que dices en el minuto <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5bOB5e9XjQ&amp;t=17m57s">17:57</a>
Hola! Muchas gracias por tu mensaje. Espero que haya sido de ayuda. <br />Espero tu suscripción si no lo has hecho, me ayuda mucho para seguir creciendo.<br /><br />Saludos!
Muy buen dato el de freedom. Gracias por compartir!
Hola! Gracias por unirte al canal. Por el momento no me han cobrado nada pero lo cierto es que todavía tengo el beneficio de los 90 días. El mes que viene se vence así que veré si realmente no se cobra nada por el VPS y solamente se hacen cobros por excedentes en el tráfico de red o tráfico a zonas no incluídas en la promoción.<br />Te comento que hay un nuevo video de Oracle Cloud que ofrece 2 vps gratis, mas potentes y sin tantas restricciones. También los estoy probando y esperando a que termine la promoción para ver si realmente son gratuitos.<br />En poco tiempo más haré un video mostrando la verdad de estas promociones.<br />Saludos!
@Apuntes IT ME PUEDE AYUDAR CON UNA CUENTA DE ESA. NO TENGO TARJETA DE CREDITO. TE PUEDO DONAR ALGO POR airtm.. SALUDO
Hola!, muy buen video, que pasa despues de los 90 dias? Te cobraron la vps?
Hola! Muchas gracias por tu mensaje. Me alegra poder ayudar. <br />Te comento que podes eliminar la maquina actual, la que tiene un costo de u$s60 y generar otra con las especificaciones para que no tenga costo alguno. Recorda que los excedentes se van a cobrar, pero de seguro no van a ser 60 dolares.<br />Lo podes hacer en la misma cuenta como dije o podes crear otra cuenta. Podes usar la misma tarjeta que utilizarte en la cuenta actual, de hecho yo tengo dos cuentas, una es la que se ve en el video y otra es la que aloja el blog y otro proyecto que tengo.<br />De verdad que es una alternativa mucho mas económica que cualquier hosting incluso si alguna vez hay que pagar algo.<br />Mira mi ultimo video donde muestro los VPS de Oracle. Son mas potentes y también son gratis.<br />Espero tu suscripción si es que fue de ayuda lo que encontraste.<br />Saludos!
Un saludo enorme y muchas gracias por tu vídeo, pero tengo una duda.<br />En 2 semanas caducara mi prueba gratuita con el crédito de los 300 USD y claro, había creado una máquina que me descuenta 60 USD mensuales pero pues no me importo porque es gratis.<br /><br />Ahora, buscando renovar mi VM me encontré con tu vídeo y es muy interesante lo que estás informando.<br />Para el proyecto que necesito está perfecto esta máquina porque no requiere mucha ram. Entonces: Crees que si elimino mi proyecto inicial y creo uno nuevo con los parámetros gratuitos tenga algún cobro con respecto a la facturación? Porque en principio estaría cumpliendo con las políticas de Google.<br />O sino, es posible usar la misma tarjeta en otra cuenta para la verificación? <br />Ya que pues si hay la oportunidad de tenerlo en mi cuenta personal perfecto, pero sino deberé estar cambiando de cuenta cada 3 meses. Aunque por el hecho de que es gratis vale completamente la pena.<br /><br />Muchas gracias por tu vídeo una vez mas y un saludo enorme desde Colombia hermano.
Hola! La promoción que se otorga es de 90 días y u$s300. Esto quiere decir que en los 90 días vas a poder utilizar todos los productos ofrecidos y se te descontarán los valores excedentes del mes de los 300 dólares. Si gastas los 300 dólares antes de los 90 días los servicios funcionarán dentro de los recursos incluídos y se suspenderán hasta comenzar el nuevo mes.<br />Una vez que terminaste los 90 días solamente puedes utilizar los servicios que respeten las cuotas incluídas mensualmente, como en el caso del VPS. Lo que excedas se cobrará.<br />Espero haber podido evacuar tus dudas. <br />Ya viste el último video? En Oracle se pueden obtener VPS gratis mas potentes y sin tantas restricciones.<br /><br />Si fue de ayuda lo que encontraste en el canal espero tu suscripción. Me ayudas mucho con tu apoyo para poder seguir creciendo.<br /><br />Saludos!
@Apuntes IT Muchas gracias, gracias por tu respuesta, muy amable
Buenas, una consulta si utilizo otros recursos que no son los gratuitos, los voy a tener gratis por 90 días y <a href="http://luego.me/">luego.me</a> empiezan a cobrar? O me empiezan a cobrar del primer mes si uso otros recursos que no sean los gratuitos?
Hola! Si lees los términos del servicios indican que no se permiten ese tipo de prácticas. Lo lamento.<br />De todos modos puedes intentarlo y ver si de alguna manera puedes engañar al sistema.<br />Saludos!
Amigo esta vps me sirve para un bot de treding
Hola! Eso es porque quiza estes intentando realizar alguna actividad no permitida en los términos y condiciones del servicio. Puede ser voluntario o algún código en lo que estás utilizando genera ese tipo de comportamiento intrusivo. <br />Otra causa puede ser que hayan encontrado un agujero de seguridad en tu proyecto y colocaron código malisioso que está realizando trading, por ejemplo, o spam. Ahora debes buscar que es lo que sucedió, eso es lo bueno del mundo IT, descubrir los problemas y poder solucionarlos cuando aparecen.<br />Te recomiendo que si aún tenes el proyecto activo y podes ingresar a la maquina investigar el los logs del sistema, verificar si no hay algún cron funcionando. <br />Ahora es tu turno de invesigar y solucionar el problema.<br /><br />Saludos.
hola creo una maquijna virtual y los dias me sale esto 
 <br /> 
 <br />Estimado desarrollador:
 <br />Hemos detectado que el IP de tu proyecto de Google Cloud My First Project (id: dotd-tide-306512) está realizando intentos de intrusión contra un tercero, por lo que hemos suspendido todos los recursos del proyecto con este comportamiento
Hola! Depende del tipo de máquina que elijas y lo que estés dispuesto a pagar por el servicio. El VPS gratis que se muestra en este video solamente admite una CPU. Pero si elijes la denominada N1-standard-96 vas a poder tener hasta 96 CPU.<br>Te dejo el enlace a la documentación donde podrás interiorizarte de todos los productos que ofrecen. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute">https://cloud.google.com/compute</a><br><br>Saludos!
@Apuntes IT hola si se un metodo para minar criptos las shitcoins nuevas, crees que podamos intentarle alli?
@Maestria Digital Agencia De Marketing Digital Hola! Según dice en los términos del del servicio no se permiten procesos de minería digital. <br>De todos modos podes probarlo, pero corres el riesgo de ser penalizado en la plataforma y que baneen tu cuenta.<br>Saludos.
@Apuntes IT yo tengo un algoritmonque camufla el minado imaginate multiples cores minando monedas baratas 24/7 facil 10mil dolares al mes,pero no conosco denrentar,ya tengo el metodo paea minar al 50% asi no levantar sospechas
@Maestria Digital Agencia De Marketing Digital Entonces podes probarlo y si funciona podés compartirlo con nosotros y ver de que se trata.<br>Saludos!
@Apuntes IT hola,podemos conversarlo via whatssap para compartirte lo que se, y como podemos hacerle para usar el trial de 96 nucleos?
@Maestria Digital Agencia De Marketing Digital Hola! Disculpame, pero no estoy interesado en la criptomineria y como te comentaba, el trial no contempla 96 núcleos y los 300 dólares de crédito creo que te los vas a gastar en menos de 1 semana.<br>Saludos.
puedo tener muchos cores como cuantos?
Hola! El último video publicado explica el modo en el que se debe borrar un VPS en GCP. Simplemente borras la máquina y ya no tenés gastos. Se pga lo que se consume.<br />Saludos!
MUY BUENO EL VIDEO ¿Cuando te queras dar de baja como es?
Hola! Si, hay que pagar por la licencia de windows y ya está fuera de los requerimientos que se debe cumplir para poder acceder a la promoción gratuita. Vas a consumir el crédito de 300 dólares y una vez que se termine ese crédito se suspenderá el servicio hasta que pases tu suscripción a cuenta de pago. Esto comenzará a generarte costos en la tarjeta de crédito que hayas utilizado en la suscripción al servicio.<br />Saludos!
Genera algún costo si selecciono Windows server
Hola! No se responder tu pregunta. Deberías probar o consultar con el servicio al cliente de Google.<br />Saludos!
@Apuntes IT ok ya revise solo targeta credito
hola aceptan targetas visa de debito soy de colombia
Lok&#39;tar ogar !
Por la horda
Willy Rengifo Acho hola sólo puede pasarle a archivos por sftp o ftp, al final del video explicó como pasar archivos. Esto es porque está en la nube y no en tu pc.
amigo una pregunta.....yo ya creuna maquina virtual pero no me sale mis discos extraibles de mi pc fisico, como hago para agregarlo
Claro que si, Debian es un sistema operativo pero puedes instalar cualquiera como viste ahi. Luego usando VNC Viewer e instalando la interfaz grafica te saldra el escritorio y ya no tendrias que usar el terminal. Pero en los servidores se usa sin interfaz gráfica sobre todo porque consume menos recursos.
Estoy montanto una maquina virtual con Ubuntu, subo un proyecto web Java application, servidor Web Apache Tomcat y Servidor Proxy HTTPS etc, visita mi canal si así lo deseas, estás invitado
discúlpame pero hay algo que no entendí lo que abriste era como una consola pero se puede montar un sistema operativo en esa maquina virtual
ok muchas gracias
@MarcosRios95 harias un video para obterner free sin tarjeta ?
Hola, para crear tu cuenta de google cloud si te pide. Pero descuida no consumirá crédito, a menos que excedas los limites gratuitos.
@MarcosRios95 pero no tengo tarjeta ;(
@Yazuki Tal vez si te registras en: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/edu/">https://cloud.google.com/edu/</a> para obtener creditos, pero es probable que no te deje usar ciertas cosas hasta que ingreses una tarjeta de crédito.
necesito poner tarjetas de creditos y esas cosas ?
Es lo mismo.
Puedes utilizarla para montar tu servidor Tomcat, desplegar Aplicaciones Webs Java con una tecnología robusta y segura, puedes instalar un Servidor Proxy, instancias y crear todo un proyecto Web totalmente funcional, todo lo estoy creando a diarío, te invito que visites mi Canal para que descubras como va funcionando paso a paso.
Funciona como una vps ??
Forma parte del Always Free de Google Cloud, por lo que se entiende que es para siempre o hasta que cambien las maquinas en el futuro.
Si, pero windows no es gratis ahi ya tienes que pagar por la licencia.
@MarcosRios95 ok gracias lo que pasa es que estoy probando una estrategia forex y no se si linux ejecute la plataforma de meta trader
@MarcosRios95se te agradeceria mucho si hicieras un video explicando como conectar la termianl a la interfas grafica en la distribucion de linux
@Nicolas Flores Hola, en este video sale como conectarte a la maquina usando putty, pero si deseas una interfaz grafica necesitas usar VNC es parecido solo cambias de programa y asegurate de instalar la interfaz grafica desde putty primero al servidorlinux: te recomiendo gnome.
Amigo sigue siendo gratis para siempre? Crees que podria montar un servidor plex alli?
Héctor Carrillo claro que si.
es gratis por cuanto tiempo? y tienen la opcion de escoger windows como sistema operativo
Gustavo Adolfo Caballero Jimenez hola mientras uses la máquina del video te sale gratis, para que no te cobren tienes que cerrar el proyecto en el lateral busca la gestión y ahí en proyectos borras el actual
<b>Amigo muy buen vídeo, ya utilice este VPS gratis y funciona muy bien pero ya consumí el crédito de $300 USD , sabes como puedo cancelar la suscripción para que no me vayan a hacer el cobro a mi tarjeta de crédito, ya que el servicio de paga es muy costoso., no he podido encontrar en la pagina como cancelar el servicio.</b>
Estoy subiendo un proyecto completo en Java EE con apache Tomcat y Con Proxy Server, Visita mi canal y descubre las novedades
bro el video esta muy bien... lo malo es la resolucion de pantalla
Aaron Bautista <a href="https://youtu.be/ZS3qyD_cveY">https://youtu.be/ZS3qyD_cveY</a>
en el minuto 1.44 como creaste eso &quot; cuenta de servicio &quot; eso me falta la neta nose de donde o como sacast eso ya creado . fail
Héctor Carrillo minuto <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSbehm2M1pg&amp;t=1m31s">1:31</a> alado del cuadro rojo dice que tu primera máquina f1 al mes bueno ahí te dice horas es gratis. Si tienes dos ya no lo es.
Amigo dices que se ve dice que sigue siendo gratis pero ahí dice que son 4.68 al mes... A mi me dice lo mismo, en dónde dices que indican que si es gratis?
Puedes verlo actualizado donde dice always free y ahi en compute engine: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/?hl=es">https://cloud.google.com/free/?hl=es</a>
Gracias por el video, de que tamaño es la cuota de datos ?
Así vienen en windows server si deseas navegar debes cambiar la configuración: <a href="https://clouding.io/kb/cambiar-configuracion-de-seguridad-mejorada-de-internet-explorer/">https://clouding.io/kb/cambiar-configuracion-de-seguridad-mejorada-de-internet-explorer/</a>
amigo ayudame... me cree una maquina virtual windows.. la abro en el escritorio remoto normalita... pero cuando ingreso al explorer no me deja navegar casi en nada... me salen puros avisos de seguridad..no me deja descargar mozilla ni nada... que hago? xfa
Es gratis, siempre y cuando sea solo una maquina y no excedas la cuota que dice en <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/?hl=es">https://cloud.google.com/free/?hl=es</a>
pero sigue costando salddo y si no tienes ps ya no puedes
ah yo avo te conosco
Hola, siempre y cuando no excedas los limites de la capa gratuita sera gratis: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/">https://cloud.google.com/free/</a>
Man puse mi targeta, me va a comenzar a dar pagos? tengo miedo :(
Josbell_ claro no es necesario porque todo corre en la nube, incluso puedes controlar desde tu móvil
@MarcosRios95 ya veo, al parecer el futuro siempre si está en la nube, con eso de stadia y shadow ... y vortex... te imaginas que dentro de poco se agregue al mismo servicio de internet?
se necesita capacidades de virtualización en el bios? como en virtual box, o puede correrse desde el buscador? por que en mi pc no puedo crear maquinas virtuales en el virtual box... algo que ver con mi tarjeta madre.
codepalace como se borra la cuenta de facturación? Ya elimine el<br />Proyecto pero aún no estoy seguro
Solo tienes que eliminar el proyecto y listo.
@MarcosRios95 gracias brother!!!
Tienes que borrar la cuenta de facturacion, para que no te cobren y no aceptar el periodo de pago
y como darse de baja???????
Entra a la configuración del proyecto y elimina desde Google cloud console. Eso garantiza que ya no te genere más gastos.
Como me doy de baja y evito que me cobren ?
Hola, no lo he usado pero debería sin problemas. O descarga la app de Google Cloud y desde ahí puedes ingresar
Funciona en Juice ssh?
Yo lo uso así, sin problema
@MarcosRios95 Si la detienes no te carga, tienes que volverla arrancar, y si borras la instancia por error tienes que volver a crearla o recuperar desde la captura que hallas hecho al disco
A los que lo usamos como VPS es normal que no nos cargue ?
Hola, yo no uso metadatos solo claves ssh. Pero revisa esta solución: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/managing-instance-access?hl=es#enable_oslogin">https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/managing-instance-access?hl=es#enable_oslogin</a>
@MarcosRios95 Muchas gracias por tu ayuda
GRacias por el video lo segui y pude crear la maquina virtual pero me da un error tienes idea de que se trata dice lo siguiente, No tienes suficientes permisos para aplicar SSH en esta instancia. Necesitas uno de los siguientes: compute.instances.setMetadata; compute.projects.setCommonInstanceMetadata; o compute.instances.osLogin (con OsLogin habilitado) y iam.serviceAccounts.actAs. y cuando le doy a metadato no hace nada
De los dos, puede cambiar eso en red. Por defecto te da una dinámica pero no afecta, porque siempre tienes las maquina encendida. Solo se cambia si la apagas, no cuando la reinicias
Puedes poner la IP Fija, es recomendable si vas a correr un proyecto Web en Java por ejemplo, con una página totalmente funcional, visita mi canal te invito
La ip publica que asignan es estatica o dinamica ?
Sirve para jugar juegos de ahora?
Puedes utilizarla para montar tu servidor Tomcat, desplegar Aplicaciones Webs Java con una tecnología robusta y segura, puedes instalar un Servidor Proxy, instancias y crear todo un proyecto Web totalmente funcional, todo lo estoy creando a diarío, te invito que visites mi Canal para que descubras como va funcionando paso a paso.
y eso para que sirve?
Hola Sebastian, debes buscar en el Marketplace de Google Cloud alguna opción que te sirva como tal puedes instalar cPanel directamente pero es un poco mas costoso también esta esta alternativa WordPress CyberPanel. Saludos
¿Cómo se puede instalar wordpress y cpanel?
Como seria si quisiera cargar una imagen iso ?
Bro para que quiero una pc así si es literalmente una PC de 1990, o sea una mierda de PC, y todavía me cobran 4 dólares por ese servicio, te ganaste un dislike, :&quot;(
excelente, acabo de aprender a usa GCP y es excelente, ahora con esto podre tener un server gratis, aunque al crear la instancia de vm podias ponerle un script para que de una vez tengas ya instalado el servidor apache o el que desees.
amigo buenass,soy de venezuela,mi pais no aparece en la lista de paises,como hago en ese caso?
Es posible crear como un PC gamer y conectarla mediante parsec y jugar?
Gracias caballero

You can deploy socket program on GCP VM instance but there could be other ways as well. You can also use google App engine for standard socket pakg - for ex -: import &quot;<a href="http://google.golang.org/appengine/socket">google.golang.org/appengine/socket</a>&quot; for more info read gcp documentation

☺️ Avinash I did call it...The term data massaging, also referred to as “data cleansing” or “data scrubbing”, may sound a bit naughty. But, it&#39;s commonly used to describe the process of extracting data to remove -unnecessary information, cleaning up a dataset to make it useable
did he say massage your data at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzwSBbuHY-0&amp;t=3m51s">3:51</a>.. lol

OK
OK
Cloud run is a managed compue platform where you can run stateless container s, its basically serverless. So if you have a container image you can directly deploy it using Google Cloud Run.
where does cloud run fit in these categories?
Thanks Nupur !!
Loved the summary. Thanks!
Thanks

Hi Ved, you can check out our GCP playlist for more videos: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUWB807TJEg&amp;list=PLEiEAq2VkUUI0xT8VNpjBuWvmnLHxPcsE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUWB807TJEg&amp;list=PLEiEAq2VkUUI0xT8VNpjBuWvmnLHxPcsE</a>
Nice to learn here. when can we get videos on further topics of GCP.
@Simplilearn so it&#39;s only free for 12 months?
Google Cloud Platform has a Free tier, for which you need to sign up initially by giving your credit card details just to ensure that you are not a bot. You won&#39;t be charged until you upgrade to a paid account. You get $300 worth credit to spend it over a period of 12 months.
Is this free or paid version of GCP?
Hi Srinivasa, thanks for checking out our tutorial and for sharing the information. Do subscribe to our channel to stay posted on upcoming tutorials. Cheers!
I am not convinced by the AWS vs Azure vs GCP. The slide was taking different things regions vs countries. A country might have less regions but spread across countries, I mean one region in multiple countries vs multiple regions in few countries. I might be wrong but just wanted to keep my point over here.
Glad you enjoyed our video! We have a ton more videos like this on our channel. We hope you will join our community!
NICEEE VIDEO
Agreed, He just clicks through a lot and reads what&#39;s on the page with no explanation of the how or the why.
Hi, Thanks for the feedback. We shall share your concerns with the concerned department.
A lot of empty words....
Thanks for watching our video. Cheers!

@Simplilearn TV
Am I supposed to understand this after the tutorial?
It depends what you mean by worth it. If a $200 certificate brings you potential to earn $20,000 in sales (from better clients), is it worth it?
@Daniel Bourke yes from an accounting standpoint that&#39;s a net revenue before tax of $18,000. However, not sure about cost benefit from an economic standpoint factoring in the opportunity cost of time, and ROI from alternative certifications / seminars.<br /><br />Also, I&#39;d have to really model out the NPV, IRR and the payback period on this investment. <br /><br />Thanks though!
Is it worth it? I am in sales, and I want to get into selling cloud services

Very good session guys! i did hear this on higher play speed!! you are spot on!! thanks.
Thanks a lot!
Very Good Session. Keep it up!
Although programming skill is not a prerequisite, it is good to have knowledge of coding as building applications for the cloud and deploying them into the GCP requires programming knowledge.
I really want to watch the video and learn Google cloud but am afraid. Please does Google cloud involve Code and HTML
WooHoo! We are so happy you love our videos. Please do keep checking back in. We put up new videos every week on all your favorite topics.

This is excellent! Very comprehensive and well explained. Thank you and keep up the good work. Hope to see more videos from you.
Many many thanks
Nice video for cloud computing things such as google platform very very nice video for computing...
Sorry about that. We will try to add it in future videos. Thanks.
It would be helpful if you would have included time stamps
Hey Diego, GCP has offerings belonging to the SaaS, PaaS and IaaS list of services.
@Simplilearn any example of PaaS?
Google App engine is a good example of PaaS
Hi Sir, is GCP IaaS only ? does it have any PaaS offerings e.g Cloud Foundry ? thanks
Can I use Google Clound as my database, mean access using ASP Classic ? my email: peter.kumwah@<a href="http://gmail.com/">gmail.com</a>
Thanks a lot 😊
Too good👍👍

Brilliant!! Thanks Simplilearn for sharing this.
Glad it helped!
Simple and easy to understand... Thanks..
Yeah I want to know the same
This was a really nice tutorial... However, can someone please tell me what are the prerequisite technologies needed to learn GCP? I am a SAP functional consultant and thinking of changing my domain....
Glad you think so! Thanks for watching!
Good for beginners
Thanks for watching our video and sharing your thoughts. Do subscribe to our channel and stay tuned for more. Cheers!
They put a lot of work and it is just OK. Remarks for others - it is super bias in favore of GCP - comparison to others with a lot of unfair generalization.
Hola Profesor muy bueno su tutorial. Quería consultarle si yo tengo una pagina principal de wordpress y dentro de ella apunto a un subdominio que tiene otra instalación de wordpress....debo crear dos proyectos y en cada uno hacer la instalación de wp? y obviamente apuntar dominio principal a 1 proyecto y dominio secundario a otro....No sé si estoy en lo cierto. Muchas gracias por su apoyo.
Y para completar la consulta...si google te cobra adicional por cada proyecto que creas o tienes hasta 24 proyectos para crear sin cargo...
mucho rodeo para poder explicar , ni haces la configuración
Buen vídeo. Por que me pide un escaneo de mi tarjeta si he visto tutoriales y no suben eso sera que hice un paso mal.
Hola Alberto simplemente creas una nueva zona DNS en el Cloud DNS de Google y en el registro A apuntas a la misa dirección IP de tu instancia. Saludos
En el caso de que se necesito apuntar dos dominios al mismo hosting, que se debe hacer?
Cual recomiendas google cloud o aws?
Mucho rodeo, ve al grano, falta de planificacion
Excelente tutorial.. saludos desde Chile
Ahora solo dan 3 meses gratis o $300 de crédito, el servicio deja de serlo cuando ocurra lo primero, mi duda es que tipo de servicios utilizabas de GCP ¿? Ya que GCP cuenta con el programa ALWAYS FREE y se supone que no deberían de cobrarte por ciertos productos siempre y cuando no excedas los limites.
nefasto google cloud me cobro y no es gratis por año.3meses y me esta cobrando y te llaman para preguntarte que estas asiendo. Famosa maquinas virtuales.😑☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹
yo tengo un robot automatizado de forex, y quiero crear una pagina para cuando apague el ordenador siga operando
Ya lo resolvi reinstalando la base de datos!, gracias igualmente, saludos
Hola, gracias por tus videos. Puedo preguntar?, luego de la instalacion ingrese al dashboar para crear un nuevo usuario con privilegios de administrador! pero no me deja hacerlo?? tampoco puedo usar los plugins.. tengo los permisos restaurados por defecto. sabes que puedo hacer para que me funcione? gracias
Mucho rollo, pensé que sería un tutorial
Hasta el minuto <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRfrfr2Dd4k&amp;t=9m30s">9:30</a> no dice absolutamente nada!... Mal video hay que optimizar el tiempo
Pésimo vídeo, en el título y en el mismo video dice que creará el primer sitio en Google claud pero en realidad solo habla de la plataforma y al final dice que en próximos videos mostrará la creación. Más de 12 minutos perdidos.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRfrfr2Dd4k&amp;t=13m05s">13:05</a> 🗣Quita la tilde! Pedazo de..
Watching and learning. Will I ever get it?
It is not simple. However, I am working hard to study 8 hours a day to learn. I hope that in 3 years I will be able to be a good professional and be a useful member for humanity.
Thanks so much for the video. I am a student of Computer Science at the University. I am interested in learning this topic.
Hi Ma&#39;am! Would to like to connect with me? I&#39;m from India and a computer science student?
This is such an amazing opportunity as a web dev student! 👏👏 thanks a bunch for this info ✨
Thank you.
please can you do the same for flutter project
please can you do the same for flutter project
we&#39;re waiting
Hey, facing same issue, how did you do it?
@Nikhil Shah It was really glitchy, maybe another browser?
Just a note to the devs, trying to actually select your academic university to sign up for the beta was near impossible. I had to write it elsewhere and try to copy paste it in.
Thanks now I understand more but still not enough to understand App Engine
Arman, you&#39;re the only one who encouraged me to use Google Cloud. Thanks a lot, I&#39;m loving it.
Hey, I tried signing up for credits but I am unable to put my school name there, seems like some bug. Please tell me any alternate way of signing up. I am really looking forward to get GCP associate certificate.
@Ryan Matsumoto I can&#39;t access it

Genial. Por ti✅
Muchas gracias, y si, subiré más sobre esta plataforma, estoy por sacar una serie sobre firebase
Buen video, sigue informándonos de temas interesantes.
Gracias a ti por comentar, pronto subiré nuevo contenido.
Buen tema. Gracias!!
Ahora estoy intentando subir uno diario, espero les gusten
Está bueno. Siga subiendo videos para aprender
Muchas gracias Gaby, seguiré avanzando día a día.
Gracias brou te quiero mucho espero que llegues lejos
Hola, muchas gracias
Saludos. muy interesante.
Muchas gracias, sacaré la actualización muy pronto, apenas entre 2021
Excelente video e información!!
Hola, ¿Cómo estamos?, google solo te cobrará si tienes algo activo, es decir, una maquina virtual, una base de datos o algo por el estilo, checa que no tengas nada activo primeramente y también puedes checar en el menú la opción facturación, en ella podrás encontrar las cuentas de facturación, verifica que tu cuenta de facturación activa tenga 0 proyectos, así no te cobrarán nada. espero te sirva mi respuesta, si tienes dudas adicionales, puedes dejarlas que yo seguido checo los comentarios. Saludos.
amigo como hago para cancelar suscripcion en google cloud porque molestando le di a crear cuenta y me facturo mi targeta de credito y pues la verdad yo no quiero pagar ningun centavo a esta cosa
Albert muy buenas tus publicaciones, solo a manera de consejo podrías aumentar la fuente o hacer zoom para que las letras se puedan leer mejor.
Quarkus tiene muy buena pinta, no lo he tocado todavía. En cuanto lo haga hago un vídeo...
estimado haber si te das un tiempo y tocas algo de quarkus, quizas una demo de un microprofile rest-client usando este framework, saludos
Hola buenas Alberto, está muy bien el vídeo! Podrías hacer un vídeo que muestre por ejemplo cómo desplegar el nuevo container sin que haya ningún tipo de downtime, es decir si se hace un cambio en el API de Node por ejemplo, y yo tengo desplegada ya la aplicación en el clúster, cómo haría para aplicar los cambios que haya hecho a posterior sin que haya downtime. Muchas gracias, creo que sería de mucha ayuda para más gente.
Se puede hacer una app tipo Uber, o a quien me recomiendas para hacer una app similar?
Muchas gracias por tu explicacion Alberto! Yo expuse el puerto 8501 para desplegar una red neuronal que clasifica imagenes y al hacer la request a la url con el socket IPEXTERNA:8501 me dice que el puerto no esta abierto. Sabes si tengo que hacer algo adicional? Desde ya muchas gracias
:)
Explicas muy bien y didáctico. Me gustaría que montaras un escenario mas complejo, como un balanceador con nginx un mysql o postgres con alguna app como wordpress o algo similar corriendo. Saludos desde Argentina!
Gracias por el aporte Walter!
Hola Albert, como siempre genial la explicación, gracias por el aporte. Sería de utilidad si hicieras un vídeo explicando cómo migrar un WordPress desde un hosting tradicional a un cloud, no pude encontrar un tutorial para ese caso. Desde ya muchas gracias!
Diria que no, hay planes con servidores gratuitos muy pequeños que creo que no es suficiente.
Hola Albert, el despliegue en google cloud se puede hacer en algún plan gratuito? o es de pago?
@Albert Coronado Estaría bien un vídeo sobre costes de estas cosas en la nube, cuando está sin carga cuanto puede salir y cuanto está a tope también. GRacias por la información
Si, fueron céntimos de Euro porque solo lo arranqué para hacer el vídeo y luego lo paré.
Si, google me cobró menos de un euro por todo
Gracias por compartir sus conocimientos, una consulta, google cobra por hacer este ejemplo?
Buenas noches, como hago para comunicar diferentes microservicios en gloogle cloud tengo entendido que se debe crear un servicio, pero como hago que se comuniquen para que la app pueda correr de manera correcta
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XORU80znx9Q&amp;t=9m29s">9:29</a> &quot;Me ha convertido los símbolos de exclamación en ls. Es habitual...&quot; Y tanto, sobre todo cuando no lo pones con comillas simples y el comando anterior ejecutado es ls :P los gurús de Bash ya saben a qué me refiero ;) Este video es muy interesante y muy claro. Los de GCP lo deberían incluir en su documentación en castellano ;)
Hola Albert, soy coordinador de la Comunidad Cloud Computing Nicaragua. Me gustaría invitarte a ser parte de la comunidad y apoyarnos con algún webinar acerca de google cloud. Esperando su respuesta.
Hola Amigo buen vídeo, si me podrías ayudar de como poder realizar este despliegue pero con un proyecto que ya tengo realizado en visual estudio code, me refiero en como puedo hacerlo para subirlo y que se me despliegue, también cuenta con base de datos en php.
Un ejemplo con sonarqube
Muy buen ejemplo practico, excelente video!
Excelente video. me ayudaste mucho con unas dudas que tenia sobre Google Cloud y las Kubernetes.
u
Buen video, me queda la duda en que momento se instalo apache o fue de la imagen que solicitaste ya cuenta con apache embebido me podrías explicar por favor. Tenía entendido que existe docker file aquí no lo vi dónde queda eso
Hola Albert me encanta tu canal soy arquitecto java y docente en una escuela tecnica, estoy interesando en explorar estas tecnologias y me gustaria un ejemplo completo en donde ponga una aplicacion en un tomcat en la registry y la despliegie con kubernetes, gracias totales desde Argentina Buenos Aires Base Aerea de Moron INAC-CIATA (Inatitiuto Nacional de Aviación civil)
Exacto. En un próximo video, voy a enseñar como hacer eso.
se puede usar dominio propio alli?
Si te refieres a multisite, pues si. Eso si, la forma de instalar es un poco diferente a lo que muestro en el video. Respecto a las multiples ip, google cloud provee un balanceador de carga nativo y si bien está en multiples ip, solo una de ellas (la del balanceador), queda expuesta a internet.
@Gravitynomad hola queria hacer la prueba, pero al usar mach no me dejaron
@Daniel Tapia Hola Daniel, si dejan, pero el proceso de validación toma un poco mas de tiempo ya que por políticas de Google, no se permite el uso de tarjetas de débito virtuales, no obstante, si haces un ticket de soporte, eventualmente la van a validar de forma manual. Si tienes cuenta rut, te recomiendo usar la tarjeta debito VISA de ellos, es mas rápido el proceso.
hola , una consulta al instalar wordpress te permite el multiblog con multiples ip?
Gracias Mathias! 🤩Si hay algún tema en particular que quieras aprender, déjame un comentario con tu sugerencia para incluirlo en mi canal. Saludos!
Se ve interesante el canal, me suscribo.
Gracias! Los únicos nodos que se encuentran en sudamerica, están normalmente en Brasil. Al igual que en mi caso te recomiendo esos nodos, los mismos del ejemplo. Saludos!
hola brother, excelente canal, un pregunta como puedo configurar la zona del clúster para colombia.
Pablo, estoy haciendo un pequeño video de como hacer este cambio de manera &quot;facil&quot; o al menos guiada, paso a paso. Esperame un poco y te lo subo ;)
Genial, Porque ya meti la pata. Y borre cosas que no debia borrar. Mañana lo miro!!
​@Pablo Sanchez Hice este video rápido con el &quot;paso a paso&quot; para solucionar el problema que tienes. Como no tuve tiempo de editarlo bien para el canal, te lo dejo en wetransfer. <br /><a href="https://we.tl/t-0LOyTAoFW4">https://we.tl/t-0LOyTAoFW4</a><br /><br />Los comandos que necesitas pegar son estos: (puedes modificar los valores si necesitas mas memoria)<br /><br />php_value post_max_size 24M<br />php_value upload_max_filesize 8M<br /><br /><br />Espero que te sirva! Saludos
@Gravitynomad Buenisimo! bien sencillo! Gracias!!!
@Gravitynomad Amigo me gustaría tener ese video pero la transferencia caduco me ayudas porfa tengo el mismo problema , Porfavor
Excelente Emprendimiento web!! lo que me surgio despues de instalar el wp al cargar un theme de prueba propio, fue que tengo que modificar php.ini el max_upload... cuando entro a al VM me salen 3 y ninguno coincide con la ip del WP. ¿Tenes idea como modificar el php.ini.?
Exacto, no se hacen cobros, es una práctica común. Puedes usar una tarjeta de debito sin saldo.
Tengo que ingresar tarjeta visa para el registro en google cloud.
Hola Alexis, puedes usar Cloudflare sin problema, es más, queda excelente si haces eso. Lo que tienes que hacer es de configurar Cloudflare en NIC y luego manejar las zonas y todo desde Cloudflare. Saludos!
Hola, muy bien video, tengo una duda, con esa IP la puedo setean con Cloudflare como DNS? Y luego poner en NIC? o se puede hacer directamente desde NIC apuntando la IP? Muchas gracias!
Gracias!!
Excelente vídeo!!
Con Zoho Mail Bro
@Gravitynomad ya lo hiciste?
Hola Adrian. En el administrador de Wordpress, ingresa en la opción de Apariencia &gt; Menu. Ahí vas a encontrar el menú que ya esta en el sitio y vas a poder modificarlo según tus preferencias.
@Gravitynomad gracias ya lo pude hacer, te felicito por el video muy claro y muy util
como puedo editar los menus de la plantilla?
Ahora estoy haciendo ese video. Ya viene :)
Josser Guzmánz si, hace tiempo.<br /><a href="https://youtu.be/sw-NhOwOQdI">https://youtu.be/sw-NhOwOQdI</a>
ahora como puedo apuntar mi dominio a la web creada?
Hola Isael, Entonces solo necesitas el webserver. Te recomiendo buscar el &quot;click to Deploy Containers&quot; de NGINX. Saludos!
Gracias Gabriel muy muy buen video y si quiero subir una pagina hecha con HTML sin usar Wordpress??
Depende de lo que estes usando... hay varias cosas que son gratis de por vida. Si tu sitio esta en Wordpress como lo que explico en este video, sigue siendo gratis.
Emprendimiento Web y hay alguna forma de conectarse por FTP?
@José Contreras No es recomendable ... esta es una instalación de producción, de alta disponibilidad, entonces cada servidor (nodo) accesa un disco virtual &quot;compartido&quot;. Siempre es recomendable crear tu sitio en una instalación local y cuando ya estas listo, lo subes. Dicho esto, lo que habría que hacer técnicamente es levantar un pod adicional con servicios FTP que tenga acceso a la carpeta de los archivos wordpress.
Emprendimiento Web gracias! Ya me he suscrito ;)
Y después de ese año, cuánto cuesta?
Gracias por tus palabras Idequel 👍👍👍
Excelente video!! (al fin lo pude ver 1:02am 😎) Leí los demás comentarios hasta ahora (34) y voy a esperar a que subas los dos más videos.<br />Gracias Gabriel por compartir! 💪
Haciendo la migración del WP y cambiar las DNS

Hola, esta instalación es un sistema de varios servidores que trabajan en conjunto y por lo tanto, escalar en cantidad de nodos es más sencillo y economico una vez que tienes todo funcionando.
@Gravitynomad entonces es más económico que el bitnami?
@Luis Fernando Alcantar Agraz Asi es
@Gravitynomad como puedo activar el certificado SSL?
Hola e visto otros tutoriales que recomiendan la versión Bitnami cual seria la diferencia entre la version que tu recomiendas y esa?
Muchas gracias Sebastian! :)<br />Hasta donde he visto, solo es compatible con los pagebuilders que aparecen en esta sección del video<br /><a href="https://youtu.be/fWzgG4qoNIo?t=296">https://youtu.be/fWzgG4qoNIo?t=296</a>
Muy buen video... Pregunta Astra es compatible con DIVI?
La arquitectura de kubernetes entrega posibilidades de escalabilidad que las otras soluciones no tienen, ademas de estar en promoción. Creo que era un tema novedoso para mostrar en un video :)
excelente video , me queda la duda de por qué recomiendas wordpress google click to deplay container y no bitnami o easy digital y otras opciones?
Hola Erik, puedes hacer una migración manual de tu sitio en Wordpress o puedes utilizar un plugin como &quot;All in one WP Migration&quot;
@Gravitynomad quiero hacer lo mismo hay algun tutorial?
Hola, tengo un ecommerce en hostgator, cómo lo podría migrar a google cloud?

Excelente tutorial!!!, Me gustaria que expliques en un video como solucionas el problema de elementor en la página SHOP de esta misma plantilla porque sale un mensaje que dice: &quot;Debes llamar a la funcion &lt;&lt;the_content&gt;&gt; en la plantilla actual.
Si, tienes que revisar que las zonas sean las gratuitas y el servicio sea en el plan mas pequeño

Hay veces que puede haber un error en la creacion de servicios de Google Cloud. Te recomiendo esperar unos minutos o bien eliminar la instalacion y crearla nuevamente. Este no es un error tuyo, es algo que puede pasar en los servicios cloud. Saludos!

Estoy creando mas contenido con tips para configurar certificados SSL y muchas cosas mas. Atento que pronto mas videos! 😉
@Gravitynomad Tengo la misma duda amigo ayuda-!
Excelente me salio, todo muy bien, favor si puede hacer una video como agregar Certificado SSL al dominio en google cloud.
Por cierto, mi dominio lo compré en google domain.. y por defecto me aparecen los mismos DNS del servidor en el dominio automáticamete...
Hola, cual es el dominio con el que tienes problemas? <a href="http://dominio.page/">dominio.page</a> me aparece como un nombre de dominio no valido. Lo primero que debes verificar es que hayas reservado la IP estática para tu VM Instance, segundo debes habilitar y crear la Zona DNS en Google Cloud, y colocar los dos registros A y CNAME, y esperar que se propague la DNS. Saludos
@Pietti el dominio en cuestion es <a href="https://alienseo.page/">https://alienseo.page/</a> y lo compré en la pagina de google domain<br />También configuré todo al pié de la letra y la web se vé con la IP , pero no con el nombre del dominio..
@medicenpris ya logre ver la web con la IP, con el nombre de dominio me carga pero no me deja verla por que el certificado SSL no es valido, te recomiendo editar el archivo wp-config.php mediante SSH con el comando &quot;sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/wp-config.php&quot; si utilizaste la version del stack Bitnami WordPress y remover el certificado SSL, esto lo haces simplemente quitando la S te debe quedar asi: define(&#39;WP_HOME&#39;,&#39;http://alienseo.page&#39;);
 <br />define(&#39;WP_SITEURL&#39;,&#39;http://alienseo.page&#39;);. Ahora debes instalar el certificado correctamente y ahí si vuelves a modificar estas lineas en este articulo explicamos como generar el certificado SSL: <a href="https://pietti.com/certificado-ssl-gratis-wordpress-google-cloud/">https://pietti.com/certificado-ssl-gratis-wordpress-google-cloud/</a>.

Hola, muchas gracias!! 🙂<br />Existen varios beneficios de utilizar kubernetes y uno de los mas importantes es la resilencia del sistema, la capacidad de &quot;auto-sanado&quot; y la escalabilidad.
Hola Hola , muy práctico el tutorial y lo mejor en chileno jeje. <br />Pero tengo una duda que me salió en comparativa a otros tutoriales. <br />¿Por qué recomiendas el despliegue de wordpress bajo la modalidad de kubernetes?? Este es el primer tutorial de todos los que he visto en que el despliegue para WP y GCP se hace en kubernetes y no bajo la imagen de VM clásica. No soy muy experto porque no soy del área de TI y recien estoy aprendiendo con WP... Pero me surgió esta duda al ver tu despliegue. Según lo que he leído, la API de kubernetes se usa para grandes proyectos que necesiten clústeres de trabajo, cosa que no me imagino con un pequeño comercio, el que se podría gestionar con VMs escalables en caso de necesitar más recursos. La única conjetura que imagino es que kubernetes es mejor por costos (para después del año gratis). Sin embargo tampoco encuentro la tarifa de kubernetes explícita como por ejemplo las tarifas que salen en los despliegues con VM (donde te muestran un costo de $XX, simulado por mes y espacio de disco). Bueno igual escribí montones jasjjs .. pero la duda es ¿Por qué para una tienda pequeña sería mejor esta imagen y una estructura kubernete ?
Como se puede modificar el disco de almacenaje o capacidad de disco del Wordpress instalado? <br />Por defecto:<br />Disco persistente estándar: 10 GB<br />Otra pregunta, de los 300$ que dan gratuitos al año, luego el precio base creo que oscila el mas económico entre los 13$?<br />Muchas Gracias por toda esta información de los videos.
La mejor forma de hacer este calculo en todas las plataformas cloud es instalar el servicio y ver cuanto te factura a fin de mes. Vas a estar cubierto por los 300 dólares, tu saldo final va a ser de CERO, pero vas a tener una idea de cuanto habría salido antes de los descuentos y así vas a poder hacer una proyección.
me gustariasaber cuanto cobra google despues de los 300 dolares gratis o espues del año
Excelente Paola, muchas gracias! 🙂
Actualmente tengo muchos problemas con mi servidor, esta alternativa me gusto, la probare esta tarde. Gracias
Hola! intenta seguir este tutorial complementario para aumentar los parametros de php. <a href="https://youtu.be/CCMR9BR_vcw">https://youtu.be/CCMR9BR_vcw</a>
Gracias por el tutorial, es justo lo que buscaba.. quería consultarte como solucionar el problema del error al instalar los templates de astra. Hago la instalación, da error como mencionas en el video, vuelvo a instalar con las instrucciones de no borrar, pero sigue dando error. Probé con varios templates de estilo e-commerce, que es lo que necesito y no logro que se instale ninguno. Me podrías ayudar a solucionarlo??? gracias
Hola Paz, dime que error sale y asi te puedo ayudar a resolver tu problema
Adicionalmente, intenta con este tutorial complementario para aumentar la capacidad de carga de archivos en la configuración PHP <a href="https://youtu.be/CCMR9BR_vcw">https://youtu.be/CCMR9BR_vcw</a>
no puedo importar los temas hice todos los pasos :c
Hola Alan, este tipo de planes cambia constantemente y efectivamente, los precios de diferentes zonas ya no son los mismos que habían cuando hice el video. Estoy en el proceso de actualizar la información, entregar mas tips y agregar mas opciones como las de agregar certificados SSL. Suscríbete a mi canal porque pronto viene mas contenido!
@Gravitynomad gracias por aclararlo tienes razon, no había considerado que los planes pueden cambiar con el tiempos. El problema que encuentro ahora es con la transferencia que Google solo te cubre 1gb... Saludos.
@Alan Munguia Estaba revisando los planes y la instancia f1 se refiere a maquinas virtuales (VM) y no al metodo de instalacion que explico en este video. En este video, hacemos uso de un cluster de Kubernetes y por cada cuenta de Google Cloud, tienes derecho a un cluster gratuito. Es decir, si sigues este video, el servicio va a ser completamente gratis. Mira en esta pagina donde dice &quot;clusteres&quot; <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free">https://cloud.google.com/free</a><br />Saludos!
@Gravitynomad No había explorado esta opción, es genial, por qué en mi instancia f1 si cobran ancho de banda, $0.12 USD por GB, el primer GB es gratis... Voy a explorar está nueva opción que mencionas. Muchas gracias.
Pero la zona (sudamérica) que usas no es gratis... Y la instancia f1 micro es la que siempre es gratis, la cual no usas.
jajajaj Gracias Rodrigo! 😃
teniai que ser shileno jajajjaja<br />bueno el video
Sabes que intente hacerlo pero me da error
Buen tutorial, sería excelente si logra subir el audio.

UPDATE: Con el siguiente tutorial complementario van a poder aumentar los parametros de Post Max Size y Upload Max Size en un cluster Kuberentes GCP<br /><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/CCMR9BR_vcw">https://youtu.be/CCMR9BR_vcw</a>
No pude instalar Astra, cuando deseo editar parámetros de Post Max Size y Upload Max Size en un cluster Kuberentes GCP me sale el siguiente aviso ---- The connection to the server localhost:8080 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?, y no se elimina por completo el Tema, ya no puedo volver a instalar me sale que ya esta instalado pero con error. Gracias por su ayuda.
Asi! <a href="https://youtu.be/sw-NhOwOQdI">https://youtu.be/sw-NhOwOQdI</a>
y cómo conecto mi dominio?
Es gratis
@Gravitynomad ah ok, pero si es grátis cuál es el límite que puede soportar mensual
De usuarios
y cuánto te cobran mensualmente por ese servidor?
Hola Andres, El servicio de Kubernetes es gratis para toda la vida lo que significa que no va a utilizar tu credito de 300 dolares y puedes usarlo por años y años.. Aqui puedes ver el detalle de los servicios Always Free de Google Cloud en donde aparece Un cluster Kubernetes de zona <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free">https://cloud.google.com/free</a><br />Saludos!!
Hola, que buen video.<br />Consulta: Luego de que pase el año gratis; cual sería el costo mensual para tener un e-commerce en linea ?
Gracias Americo!
@Gravitynomad estamos esperando como validar el SSL, ojala puedas hacer un video explicativo

Hola Cristian, los registros DNS para los sitios web, suelen ser de tipo A o de tipo CNAME. Los registros que debes modificar para tu correo son los MX, lo que significa que puedes tener tu correo en un servicio A, tu xsitio web en un servicio B y asi... una cosa no cambia o desconfigura la otra. Si necesitas ayuda te invito a mi comunidad de FB. Saludos!<br /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/emprendimientoweb">https://www.facebook.com/groups/emprendimientoweb</a>
Muy buen video! tengo una duda.. como tendría que hacer para tener el correo &quot;corporativo&quot; con el dominio propio?? ya que al tener un hosting uno tiene la opción de crear correos.. pero al sustituir el hosting por el de GCP perdería esa opción, o no??? gracias!
Hola el archivo wp-config.php si instalaste Bitnami WordPress puedes acceder mediante el siguiente comando mediante SSH &quot;sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/wp-config.php&quot; si es otra instalación diferente puede que este en otra ruta que normalmente puedes acceder mediante&quot;sudo nano /var/www/html/wp-config.php&quot; el archivo .htaccess en el stack de Bitnami funciona diferente puedes leer esta documentación: <a href="https://docs.bitnami.com/oci/apps/wordpress/administration/use-htaccess/">https://docs.bitnami.com/oci/apps/wordpress/administration/use-htaccess/</a>.

Hola!, puedes seguir las instrucciones de uno de mis otros videos, ahi explico como configurar dominios!
y como se coloca el <a href="http://dominio.com/">dominio.com</a><br />o los clientes solo entrararn con una ip
Hola Claudia, El error ocurre cuando intentas abrir una URL con HTTPS sin tener un certificado SSL instalado. Puedes instalar un certificado o usar HTTP o incluso simplemente ignorar el error. Saludos!
Hola! Me sale como página peligrosa al darle al IP y cuandod intento ingresar me sale Error: Server Error
 <br />The server encountered a temporary error and could not complete your request.

Hola! hice todos los pasos pero me arroja un error y no puedo entrar a wordpress, (wordpress-2-wordpress-ingress Todos los servicios de backend están en estado INSUFICIENTE) tendras algun conocimiento de qué hacer en este caso?
Si, lo voy a subir próximamente 😉
Hay un plugin que se llama simple SSL, es un candado la imágen, lo buscas en plugin o extensiónes
Tienes videos sobre la instalación de certificado de seguridad?
Tienes que pagar un dólar para acceder a los 3000 dólares.
Esta bien, todas las tecnologias cloud te piden esa validacion para asegurar que no vas a usar el servicio de forma fraudulenta. Ingresa una tarjeta de debito, no te van a cobrar, es solo para efectos de validación. Saludos!
Cuando presiono configurar en wordpress, me sale que tengo que ingresar mis datos y de tarjeta para la prueba gratuita. Será asi ahora al día de hoy o hice algo mal.

Como puedo activar el certificado SSL?
Jajajaja Gracias!! 😃<br />En este momento lo voy a cambiar y veamos como reacciona en los proximos dias.
@Gravitynomad Si se nota la subida? Acabo de llegar
es tan bueno el video que no puedo no ayudarte con el Branding:<br /><br />Como INSTALAR Wordpress GRATIS Y DE POR VIDA en Google Cloud<br /><br />verás como sube ese video
Hola Buenas, estoy usando los servicios de Google Cloud actualmente con los $300/año en 2 sitios que tengo, justamente necesito migrar mis sitios de Cloud a un host mas economico porq en 3 meses se me acaba el credito, con este tuto que explicase e instalando la version de WP que usaste el alojamiento es gratis de por vida?no corren los $300/año? sabes que limitaciones tiene?
Exacto Diego 👍
Hola y por ejemplo si quiero tenerle un dominio, tengo que pagar por uno?
Hola William, he observado que en las ultimas instalaciones de Bitnami se demora en tomar la clave, inténtalo de pronto en otro navegador, sino te toca cambiar la clave por medio de phpMyAdmin en este video se muestra como acceder: <a href="https://youtu.be/FW-7XLlWaMs">https://youtu.be/FW-7XLlWaMs</a>. Saludos
@Pietti Hola, muchisimas gracias. Ahora funciona perfectamente. Lo que no he podido es instalar el certificado SSL.<br /><br />Agregué mi dominio sin problemas y segui el tutorial para agregar un certificado SSL, pero al llegar a la parte de mover el paquete Certbot-Auto en Google Cloudm ingreso la linea de codigo y se me borra toda la pantalla
@William Alexander nunca había escuchado este error, prueba ingresando el comando como root mediante &quot;sudo -i&quot; y después &quot;sudo mv certbot-auto /etc/letsencrypt/&quot;. Recuerda que no es necesario que inicies todo el proceso. Saludos
@Pietti Muchas gracias! lo he intentado de nuevo pero aún no lo consigo. Debo decirte que me impresionó la velocidad de carga del sitio! Realmente vale la pena! <br /><br />Actualmente tengo un WordPress instalado en Hostinger y se nota muchisimo, pero muchisimo la diferencia al cargar la pagina.<br /><br />Lastima que por lo que entendí, una vez finalizado el periodo de prueba el costo en google cloud mensual por el plan que muestras en el video no baja de 17 usd mensuales, ....pueden ser mas dependiendo del trafico del sitio, pero nunca menos. Es asi?<br /><br />Mi blog lo tengo para jugar, y no es rentable, así que voy a tener que quedarme con las ganas por el momento.
@Pietti Ahora pude completar todos los pasos perfectamente, ya no me dio error. Aparentemente está todo perfecto, solo que al recargar la pagina sigo saliendo como sitio no seguro. Quizas tarden un poco en activarse los certificados...<br /><br />Me esta gustando mucho esto, ...jeje...sé que 17 usd no es mucho, pero yo soy de Argentina, aca es una fortuna..jaja. Pero me lo estoy pensando, la velocidad de carga es increible
@William Alexander si mas o menos ese es el costo mensual pero con la configuración de esa instancia podrías alojar varios sitios web y el rendimiento no se vería afectado ni el costo. En nuestro curso de WordPress Google Cloud <a href="https://pietti.com/curso/wordpress-google-cloud/">https://pietti.com/curso/wordpress-google-cloud/</a>, enseñamos como configurar una instalación de WordPress para sitios web con trafico moderado, y solo pagando alrededor de 3 dolares al año por los servicios de GCP, mediante los servicios Always Free de Google Cloud. Saludos
@William Alexander aprovecha las pruebas gratis, puedes inclusive crear otra cuenta después de finalizada y pasar tu instalación de WordPress para esa nueva cuenta y extender tu periodo de prueba, así también practicas y te familiarizas mas con GCP. Sobre los certificados estos deben aparecer enseguida sino es así es posiblemente por que tengas contenido mixto te recomiendo este articulo donde explicamos como corregirlo: <a href="https://pietti.com/como-arreglar-advertencia-contenido-mixto-wordpress/">https://pietti.com/como-arreglar-advertencia-contenido-mixto-wordpress/</a>. Saludos
@Pietti Entonces puedo alojar mas de una instalación de WordPress por en el mismo plan de 16 usd? Entendí que debería pagar eso por cada sitio de WordPress. Pero si puedo alojar varios sitios entonces sí me puede resultar rentable. No se que son los servicios de GCP. Por cierto, el blog que subi sigue como sitio no seguro. Dentro del escritorio de WordPress las urls se ven con https:// pero en el navegador no. Algo hice mal. Voy a checkar el curso.... gracias por tus consejos!
@Pietti Te hago una pregunta mas. En caso de que no logre configurar los certificados SSL, es posible pagar por un certificado con el proveedor del dominio (en mi caso namecheap) y usarlo con google cloud? , o podria comprar un dominio de google domains que incluya el certificado? Se que en un hosting normal se podria, pero esto del google cloud es nuevo para mi.
@William Alexander si puedes tener mas de un sitio web, pero debes utilizar LAMP Click-to-Deploy, yo tengo con esta configuración 10 sitios alojados y funcionan perfectamente. Si en el escritorio de WordPress se muestra el certificado significa que esta instalado correctamente. Si en el blog o front end no lo ves como seguro la razón es el contenido mixto en link que te envié se muestra como corregirlo es muy fácil y no necesitas comprar ningún certificado. Saludos
@William Alexander no es necesario, lo mejor es el que ya tienes instalado revisa el articulo de nuestro blog de como corregir contenido mixto y lo solucionas. Saludos
​ @Pietti Muchas Gracias de nuevo. Revisé el articulo que me dices en tu blog. Utilicé la herramienta <a href="http://whynopadlock.com/">whynopadlock.com</a> para ver que es lo que esta generando el error y obtuve estos dos errores:
 <br />
 <br />1) Self Signed Certificate: Your SSL certificate appears to be self signed.
 <br />Browsers will display an error whenever someone attempts to visit your site.
 <br /> 
 <br />2) Domain Matching: Your SSL certificate does not match your domain name!
 <br />Protected Domains:
 <br />No Domains Listed
 <br />
 <br />Significa que no ingresé bien el nombre del dominio al hacer la instalacion? Digo por lo de no domain listed
@William Alexander escríbeme a través de <a href="http://pietti.com/">pietti.com</a>, y me indicas tu dominio, para revisar. Saludos
Todo perfecto con la instalacion, pero no pude ingresar al escritorio de wordpress, la contraseña generada por bitnami no me la reconoce, a alguien le paso lo mismo?
Disculpa, tengo un sitio en google cloud asociado a mi nombre dominio, pero no estoy logrando activar los certificados SSL. Pensé que en este tutorial mostrarias eso (asi fue como llegue a tu canal). Es que un sitio sin certificados SSL no sirve.... queda bloqueado, ni que decir sin un nombre de dominio. Tienes algun video en el canal sobre eso? Gracias! Muy buen video
Interesante, sabes si al cambiar la contraseña de wordpress se actualiza automaticamente en el panel de google? Por cierto, no estoy seguro, pero, creo que se puede hacer lo del certificado con letsencript, lo voy a probar luego
Hola Oscar, si, las puedes modificar. Esta imagen se encuentra en un repositorio de Github, puedes hacer tu propia implementación.
Una consulta las imagenes tambien las puedo cambiar???
Gracias! 🙂
Mastestro!! recién me topé con tu canal, no sé como no lo encontré antes para aprovechar la cuarentena, pero aquí me estoy suscribiendo.
Gracias Javier! 🙂
El unico que dijo ese detalle tan imporante de &quot;tienes que esperar una media hora o mas para que el DNS se propague&quot;, de tantos videos que vi
Gracias Alex! Puedes seguir mis otros videos para agregar tu propio dominio a Google Cloud. <br>Revisa este video. <a href="https://youtu.be/sw-NhOwOQdI">https://youtu.be/sw-NhOwOQdI</a>
Muy bien explicado todo, pero hay una cosa, configurar el URL para que no salgan puros numeros si no, el dominio comprado, si alguien ha pasado por esto ayuda!!
Hola Alejandro! muchas gracias! 😊 <br>Puedes acceder a cada pod de forma independiente y también (lo que quizás es mejor camino), puedes crear tu propio archivo YAML con tu propia implementación. El instalador de este video en realidad es un proyecto en Github. Puedes hacer un Fork, modificarlo y implementar tus propios cambios, de esta forma tendrias algo standard y facil de instalar/replicar y mantener. Es un tópico avanzado y fuera del alcance de este video, pero es algo que puedes 👍
Excelente video (regale like). Una duda... Con este metodo se instala en el contenedor PHP, MYSQL y.... apache o Nginx? es posible acceder al CLI e instalar Redis (para cache de BD)?
Hola Jems. Puedes ver el siguiente video, a mi me gusta usar Namecheap. :)<br><a href="https://youtu.be/rxKGLpx36G4">https://youtu.be/rxKGLpx36G4</a>
Como es el tema con el dominio? donde puedo escoger?
Si! Puedes pagar ambas cosas. 👍
Con los 300 dolares que nos brindan podemos comprar el dns y el ssl que brinda google?? espero su respuesta crack
Solo debes usar http:// en lugar de https:// al comienzo de tu dirección
@Gravitynomad explicas muy bien y eso se agradece, instale y todo ok. Ojala pudieras enseñar ahora a como cambiar la ip por el nombre de dominio propio, porque hasta ahi no se como hacerlo.
Al hacer click en el admin adress, firefox me arroja una alerta riesgo potencial de seguridad por un certificado no valido, que puede ser?

Muy buen video, te hago una consulta... cual es la diferencia entre elegir en MarketPlace WP con un click y el de WP con Bitnami?
Gratis? Así de por vida? O solo hasta agotar los creditos? Saludos desde Talca
x2
¿La pagina sigue siendo gratis después de que se acabe el dinero de regalo o los 90 días?
Y cuando terminan los 3 meses de prueba, no me van a cobrar por el hosting o por la instancia en Linux worpress?
Hola me podrias aclarar una duda, la instalacion es gratis pero se pagan adicionales sobre el uso de cloud?
Wowww lo terminé de ver y es una maravilla todo un crack
Crack claro. Consiso
Conseguiste el certificado? tambien estoy buscando una manera de obtenerlo
Hola, muchas gracias por el video, tengo una pregunta ¿Como puedes agregar certificación SSL a nuestra pagina? o en otras palabras el &quot;candado&quot;

Una tienda sin SSL ,????? Hubieras explicado cómo corregir eso
Es gratis mientras tengas tu crédito que te regala Google, pero después del año de prueba o se termine tu crédito te empieza a cobrar. confirma porfavor.
No es GRATIS! cambia de titulo porfavor, he vuelto caer por segunda vez por aqui
ahora pide datos bancarios
Gracias por tus videos, una pregunta, yo compre un dominio con Google y quiero agregarlo a Hostgator? Tienes algun video al respecto, agradecere mucho tu ayuda.
Buen video , pero ¿Recomiendas que las personas difundan la IP? Eso si no es recomendable por un tema de seguridad, no debería difundirse la IP.
malisimo el video, te la pasaste hablando y no hiciste nada
porque usar la version one click y no la de bitnami -??
Sí funciona eres el puto crack!
ta weno el tutorial. muchas gracias por la info. claro y conciso.
cuanto cuestaen USD el servicio de google cloud a compaación de godaddy u otros servicios ?
Es de por vida si vas cambiando de cuenta cada año o literal el hosting no te cobra de por vida?, por cierto buen video
Muy buen video.
Solo te faltó cumplir lo que dices en el título. GRATIS Y DE POR VIDA.
Hola! Gracias por tu video, realmente es muy bueno.. quería preguntarte para adquirir el servicio de cloud con google, cual configuración se debería usar? ya que se dan muchas opciones... y como influye el SEO con google cloud?

yo sigo buscando como añadirle el ssl, tambien espero!!
Hola, todavia no has sacado ningun tutorial para añadirle un SSL? Saludos.
Hola, buen video. He intentado crear pero me pide registrar tarjeta para facturación. Quisiera saber si cobra o no? Podrías hacer otro tuto similar actualizado al 2021. Saludos

Hola. Gracias por ser tan claro y rapido en todos tus videos. Amaría que sigas subiendo contenido para gente como yo que desea aprender. Gracias y abrazo grande
Hola Arthur depende de las configuraciones elegidas en tu VM instance pero el costo comienza en 5 dolares mensuales aproximadamente. Al momento de escribir este comentario Google Cloud te ofrece $300 dolares o 90 días de crédito para cuentas nuevas. Saludos
Hola, que costo tiene este servicio de google Cloud.?
Actualmente me está generando &quot;costos&quot; por habilitar API de Kubernetes Engine , habrá alguna forma de evitar este costo? De momento me lo descuenta de la cantidad de créditos que tengo, pero si lo dejo trabajando así llegará a gastárselo por completo y me cobrara directamente a mi tarjeta.
El mejor video que me pude haber encontrado. ;-;
me pide agregar una tarjeta de credito o debito... por que?
No queda claro si realmente es free para siempre. Hay otros servicios que necesitas para tu tienda como SSL y DNS para usar tu dominio. Con todo igual sale gratis?
como hago para poner el nombre de mi web en vez de los numeros
seguro que es gratis ? me pide tarjeta

SECO! :D gracias
Una <a href="http://cosa.si/">cosa.Si</a> cierras los projectos ya no te cobra nada?
Hola Duglas , una vez acabado el periodo se pierden los que no utilizaste. y sobre Google maps lo he utilizado con la key pero no sabía que te daban créditos gratis también, <br />Saludos!
Muchas gracias por la explicacion del video, ¿que sucede con los créditos que no hayas utilizados después de los 12 meses? y también en mi caso en general yo lo uso por la API_KEY de Google Maps, y supuestamente te dan unos 200 dolares mensuales gratis, tuviste alguna experiencia usando algo así antes y después del periodo de prueba que te da Google ?<br />De nuevo muchas gracias por la explicación
Que tal , mo me ha pasado con Google Cloud, aunque es una practica común para verificar la validez, te quitan un dolar o menos pero te lo regresan en unas horas.
una pregunta amigo al ingresar la tarjeta al principio te cobran algo o no???
Que buena observación, si fue un error , no me di cuenta que lo tenía en MXN, se tendría que hacer la conversión o cambiar la moneda en las configuraciones. Saludos!
@DATACLOUDER saludos y muchas gracias por tu ayuda
amigo los 25 que pusiste son en dolares o en pesos mexicanos por que en el minuto <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0v3ZRGgYbY&amp;t=10m37s">10:37</a> del lado derecho de el presupuesto dice mxn
Buenas amigos gran vídeo, tengo una duda, es un trabajo de la universidad, si yo tengo mi proyecto hecho en Proteus usando Arduino para la programación, que opción debería elegir? Agradecería mucho de tu ayuda, gracias
A veces lo hacen para verificación, te lo tienen que regresar en las próximas horas :D
hola, Pero imaginate que me registre con mi tarjeta de credito y me cobro 1 dolar.
Hola Dataclouder, ya paso 1 año y me empezaron a cobrar el servicio, resulta que lo probé, pero no seguir usando el servicio como lo cancelo del todo para que no me vuelvan a cobrar? he buscado, como cancelar y aun no encuentro como cancelar!
Tendrías que aprender un poco más, sobre todo si tienes una carrera en computación, investiga tus dudas, luego poco a poco entendarás las posiblidades que te ofrece la nube y como crear plataformas que puedas vender y ganar dinero.
No entiendo que es todo esto de que me serviria comprar una de estas paginas es decir no se nada de este tema y no entiendo de que me sirve invertir en esto y como le hago para generar dinero
Te vas al menu -&gt; facturación y en la parte derecha encuentras una tarjeta informativa que dice credito de la prueba
Como saber cuanto me esta quedando de los $300, no encuentro esa informacion
ve al menú -&gt; facturación -&gt; informes, -&gt; ahi vas a ver en que se esta gastando, es raro quizá activaste servicios demás que no utilizas, lo más facil es cerrar el proyecto para dejar de facturar. te comento que las póliticas cambiaron para las cuentas nuevas. ya solo dan 3 meses de prueba, Si la creaste hace 6 entonces te debiste acabar todos los créditos.
@DATACLOUDER gracias ! Ya lo había borrado
hola amigo, yo lo estaba usando, todo bien por algunos meses , pero antes de cumplice el año llevo como 6 meses y6 ya me esta cobrando 44 us, como puedo hacer para parar esa facturacion?
yo la tengo con una de debíto debería funcionar, que error te sale? a veces para comprobar hace un cobro de 1 dolar, que se te regresa, tu tarjeta debería tener saldo, y las otras plataformas son AWS o Azure pero igual necesitas ingresar tu tarjeta
@DATACLOUDER Muchas gracias por desponder. Sale error en el numero es decir coloco todos los datos y me remarca el numero de tarjeta, e probado con 2 tarjetas y el mismo problema es mas tengo saldo disponible y todo en la cuenta y no e tenido problemas e abonado distintos servicios, ensima quiero consultar al banco pero con todo esto de la pandemia por aca es imposible
Una consulta como hago si no tengo tarjeta de credito e intentado con la de debito pero da error existe alguna forma sin tarjeta o bien alguna otra plataforma similar con pruevas de 30-60 dias o con un monto como esta
Yo tengo el mismo problema como lo solucionaste?
Me pide verificación de tarjeta...siempre es asi?
Hola, el plan gratuito se termina solo pasando los 90 días ó que hayas terminado los 300 dolares lo que pase primero, para que después no te cobren, tienes que cerrar todos tus proyectos (eliminarlos)
@ΞL CΛPO JHP gracias eres muy amable
No hay de que.👌🏻
Hola, me podrías ayudar. Cómo hago para cancelar el plan gratuito y dejar de usar el Google platform ? Agradezco mucho su ayuda
Hola, cuando me registro no me cobra nada en la tarejta? cuando es cuando si me cobra, al terminar los 90 días?
Hola, el plan gratuito se termina solo pasando los 90 días ó que hayas terminado los 300 dolares lo que pase primero, para que después no te cobren, tienes que cerrar todos tus proyectos (eliminarlos).<br /><br />En mi recomendación es mejor que llegues a gastar casi tu cuenta, cuando te encuentres en el final de cobro y sepas que tu sistema ya está muy bajo, dejes terminar tu Google cloud con 90 días, borras todos los proyectos y puedes hacer una copia de seguridad, creas otra cuenta y te dan otros 300 dls.
De nada.👌🏻
@ΞL CΛPO JHP ok gracias!
Buenas! Como se cancela esto? No encuentro como hacerlo... Cuanto me podrían cobrar si no consigo cancelar?
La cuenta como tal no se puede borrar, NO hay cargos por entrar a la consola de gcp, lo que puede cobrar es tener proyectos con recursos que no son gratis, si lo que quieres es borrar tu proyecto. Menu -&gt; IAM administración -&gt; Configuración y le das en Cerrar
Puedes subir un video de como Borrar la cuenta Google Cloud y el metodo de pago no me deja
Me aclaraste muchísimas dudas. Gracias!!!!!
Hola mi tiempo de prueba esta por terminar y google me pide que habilite la facturación automática, pero tengo la duda si ahora google me cobrará por mi instancia de maquina virtual f1 micro una vez acabado el plazo que se supone es siempre gratis, debo habilitar la facturación automática ¿? alguien ya lo hizo? Gracias por sus respuestas de antemano.
Excelente explicación hombre, al que se le da enseñar hacer ver todo fácil. Casi me ahogo mirando todas las opciones 😰
Me han preguntado mucho esto, la verdad no se cual es el parámetro para validar, puede depender del país, o el banco, también a veces tienen que hacer un cargo de 1 dólar para validar que es valida y tiene fondos, pero en general es confiable si validas tu info.
@DATACLOUDER Bro, muchas gracias pro responder, ya me validaron la tarjeta ya que tuve que contactarme directamente con el soporte de google y hacer la peticion y todo en ingles, pero ahora tengo la duda, despues de que pasen los 90 dias de cuenta gratis, cuando cobran despues? osea, ya se que hay una calculadora de precios y todo eso, pero en teoria solo utilizo la api de google maps que te da un credito mensual de 200 dolares y pues no me los acabo pero no se con solo utilizar eso cuando me cobren al terminar mi periodo de prueba en google..
Genial, me alegra saberlo, Pues en teoría, mientras continúes con un consumo bajo que no supere tu créditos nada, esos créditos son adicionales a los servicios GCP, los de google cloud son 300 en total se acaban y ya, los de google maps son recurrentes cada mes de por vida, salvo que cambien las políticas.
@DATACLOUDER Osea que si termina mi periodo de prueba no habra ningun problema y podre seguir asi con la cuenta como estoy osea no tendria que contratar o alguna otra cosa asi en la cuenta solamente no sobrepasarme de los costos de google que me dan de 200 mensuales por la api entonces no hay ningun problema si no le doy en &quot;activar&quot;, muchas gracias por tomarte el tiempo de contestarme.
@Soluciones Empresariales siendo honesto, no tengo experiencia reciente con algún proyecto usando Google maps, estas políticas de los 200 $ es relativamente nuevo, pero algún día salió al tema con mis colegas y al parecer si, así comencionas funciona, saludos !
Hola bro, espero puedas ayudarme, al momento que tengo mi cuenta y que comienzo para la prueba y todo eso al momento de meter mi tarjeta me pide dice que tienen que verificar la cuenta y todo eso y no entiendo por que me mandan todo eso, a ti no te hicieron esos pasos podrias ayudarme?
Hola! Sí, yo saqué dos cuentas de GCP con la misma tarjeta de crédito.<br />Saludos!
se puede usar la misma tarjera de credito con varias cuentas google ?
Tus servicios automáticamente se suspenden, al menos que aceptes cambiarte de versión, cuando te llegue la notificación, luego si tienes dudas puedes borrar el proyecto en Menu -&gt; IAM administración -&gt; Configuración y le das en Cerrar
Una duda como cancelo el pago una vez finalizado el tiempo de prueba ??
entiendo una vez que borre el proyecto ya no me cobrarian dinero real de mi cuenta bancaria una vez finalizado el periodo de prueba
la documentación es buena, si quieres algo dinámico Mediante <a href="http://qwiklabs.com/">Qwiklabs.com</a> son los tutoriales guiados, te crean una cuenta especial y todo para que aprendas, son de paga excepto si tienes cuenta en pluralsight o Coursera, vienen con la subscripción, Muchas veces solo busco el tema que me interesa en qwikabs y leo el detalle de la actividad , aunque no lo implementar termina dándote una idea de cómo funcionan las cosas
Como se puede aprender a manejar todas estas herramientas? Azure tiene toda una plataforma que te guía, pero en Cloud no encuentro donde.
HOLA BUEN VIDEO UNA CONSULTA AMIGOS POR AHORA AUN TENGO DISPONIBLE LOS 300 DOLARES DE CREDITO AL TERMINAR LOS 300 DOALRES DE CREDITO COMPRO 300 DOLARES DE CREDITO POR 4 DOLARES VERDAD ?
:( no hay manera amigo. lo siento. algunos pocos productos como bigquery, no requieren tarjeta.
No manches, pero yo no tengo tarjeta, ahora qué hago??
@DATACLOUDER lo mismo me fije, el año pasado si era de un año gratis, una pregunta ... seria gratuito para siempre si lanzo un wordpress con dominio ? o en una instancia micro puedo alvergar varios wordpress? gracias
Hola yo acabo de abrir un negocio de mecánica de emergencia en la carretera los clientes me buscan en Google maps pero aparezco en el #40 como puedo hacer para aparecer en los primeros lugares tu me podrías ayudar ? De antemano gracias y bendiciones
Ya solo serán 3 meses ;( Es una verdadera lastima, revisé y parece que cambiaron las políticas para todos.
@sabria94 así es las condiciones de siempre gratiuto no han cambiado, pero el dominio se tiene que registrar con cloud DNS y si tiene un costo de $.4 por cada millón de peticiónes, si es un blog/ecomerce chiquito no rebasarás esa cantidad por lo que considera que tu costo mensual sería maximo .4 dolars mensual, muy economico, si puedes tener varios wordpress en una maquina, nunca lo he hecho, pero seguro que las configuraciones no son tan fáciles.
Al momento de registrarme dice 300$ para 90 dias es por la región? soy de Bolivia

GCP is one of the easiest cloud to get started with.
@Kumar Navneet Definitely!
good stuff. gcp is really powerful but can be tricky to get started
Finally👏lols
Cool!
Nice video - shared it to my Computer Science coursemates! Nice t-shirt btw, where can I get some GCP stash??
This is a very good video. The pace that technical materials are presented is fast which makes for a great product review to see which products are good for which types of services.
This is a good introductory video. Please create more of these.
sorry need 1 account google cloud
Nice and simple. Loved it
@Alexis Moussine-Pouchkine You mean Qwiklabs.
Look for &quot;Quickstarts&quot;.<br />Also a future episode will cover the many other resources to get started. Spoiler: <a href="http://g.co/codelabs/cloud">g.co/codelabs/cloud</a>
@Z3U5 whichever one works best for you!
&#39;Getting Started&#39; section doesn&#39;t seem to have any tutorials
Any tutorial on https SSL for compute engine.. Using node js
That&#39;s great Malcolm. All the best for your future.
Just finished Google AdWords and Analytics Certifications I’m leaning th towards GCP to be all encompass but I’ll give AWS a much deeper look for sure
AWS ( Amazon Web Services owns 51% of the market ) or GCP - Microsoft Azure is good also but mainly GCP and AWS
From big data and cloud computing which is best to learn as a beginer ? And for high unexpected future requirements ??
Awesome thanks for the inspiring information ☺
Small business information systems. Database management, a big system server without a physical big server cost or rental space used, and website management. Also other Google benefits like Google hangout for company video conferences and google ads to shift target clients towards your website.
@David Scott No difference at all, but added convenience.
@Mr. Berry How is it different from G Suite?
What is it used for?
Great video, keep them coming!
@Alexis Moussine-Pouchkine why only python
That&#39;s a great question. Go, Java, python, node.js are really well supported across the platform but I would probably start with Pyhton if you don&#39;t have a strong preference.
which language should someone learn to build an app on Google Cloud ?
Hi is GCP a free or we need to sign up for this?
I had just signed up for GCP today. I have not searched YouTube for GCP. But suddenly this appeared in my recommendations. :/ and yes, web activity is disabled.
Zhame Pace GCP is free, but you’ll need to sign up. Deploying resources will cost though.
There are some free courses on Coursera
I&#39;ve started my journey learning GCP here, please let me know the right resources to get learning interesting and then get certified
Present!
IoT! is there an integration with Cisco and AppDynamics?
Present!
Present!
😍😍😍😍
Thanks Man for your explenation
So, GCP essential videos is more fundamental for beginners compared with in-depth tutorials? What is your recommend study path?

Debit card bro, then you can only spend money you actually have.
Cancel my membership now.
Cancel now.
ahh bogus, I need a credit card for this, but credit cards are evil.
Didn&#39;t find any of that to be helpful or informative. I&#39;m just looking to host a my already existing website. I need a beginner&#39;s guide on how to do so.
Cancel my account.Not interested
google cloud platform
Its googles offering to compete with AWS - Amazon Web Services - it&#39;s a place to put your &quot;stuff&quot; in the cloud instead of having to buy/build/maintain physical hardware - generally targeted towards enterprise use I would say. Hope this helps.
Keith yes it did! Thank you! Now by stuff you mean our codes or just data?
@R everything
I&#39;ve watched several videos like this, and not one of them has told me what GCP <i>actually</i> is!
With out gmail account. Is there any other ways to access the Google cloud console?

If you’re from India please don’t try this your going to lose your money.
This is my last hope I have call send a mail,live chat and support I have tried everything to contact and complain my problem with goggle cloud but there is no response.
No reply from here too . Ok now I know that I won&#39;t get my money back. And there is no free trail
@NUKE /JEFFREY Here a lot Problems to, for Website hosting unusable, instead of helping people get bux fixed they only announce their products. No usability ex gsutil - rewrite urls by downloading - instead of downloading file you download a redirection information site . GOOGLE CLOUD NIGHTMARE - FAKE GERMAN SUPPORT HOTLINE HAMBURG - PASSWORD UNSECURE IN CHROME SYNCHRONISATION- NO SUPPORT - SERVER PROBLEMS UTF 8 - TO SEARCH FOR SOLUTIONS YOU GET ONLY GOOGLE DOCUMENTATION SHOWN - THATS A NO GO FOR DEVELOPERS - ON GOOGLE DRIVE THEY DO , ON GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE YOU ONLY RUN FROM ONE PROBLEM TO THE NEXT AND WASTE YOUR TIME -
Primeraaa😁
Hola te puedo decir algo en tu pc con que grabas?
Por ese puto Google cloud no puedo comprar en Google play
Hermano que bazofia de video, básicamente nos muestras como lees tu propio blog? 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️<br /><br />Creo que ni vos entendes lo que estas diciendo
Muchas gracias¡ para que bueno que te gusté se vienen más buenos :D
Que buena narrativa y contenido arqui, sigue así
Hola, si lo quieres controlar desde tu computadora local, el proceso general es conectarte por ssh, activar una configuración para hacerla pública y que la puedas controlar desde tu Windows local. Pero a así a detalle no estoy seguro, pero si algún día tengo que hacer algo similar, seguro que haré un vídeo explicando cómo lo logré, saludos
​@DATACLOUDER He visto varios tutoriales y todos son como de next next next, pero a la hora de conectarme con el rdp dice que el servicio remoto no esta conectado y he configurado puertos pero nada. la idea es conectarme a una instancia desde mi computadora. Bueno seguiré intentado. gracias
​@gadgets Amigo me acordé que hice un ejercicio similar mientras estudiaba para la certificación de gcp, conoces qwiklabs? son ejercicios guiados, son de paga, pero la instrucciones son públicas, creo que este es el que buscas <a href="https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/560?parent=catalog">https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/560?parent=catalog</a>
@DATACLOUDER Gracias le daré un vistazo
Hola gadgets <br />Yo te puedo ayudar si gustas, tengo dos proyectos con servidores virtuales y funcionan muy bien.
@Erick Garay Gracias Erick, He solucionado el problema, al parecer era problema con la version que tenia instalada donde se iba a trabajar la vm, Se reinstalo y problema solucionado.
hola, has trabajado con las instacias VM , es que he querido realizar una de windows server que es lo mas apegado a windows de escritorio y no me he podido conectar. Me podrias orientar?
Quiero crear un VM con Sistema Operativo Haiku (BeOS), me puede ayudar
Por ejemplo para ver gráficamente el escritorio y controlar con el mouse desde otra computadora? Es muy complicado en Linux, tendrías que instalar un server para escritorio remoto (remote desktop) como Remmina pero toda la instalación y configuración por consola, nunca lo he hecho. Tal vez encuentres una distro que ya venga por default con un software similar, suerte amigo .<br /><br />Si usas windows ya trae RDP, puedes conectarte facilmente desde otra windiows
@DATACLOUDER Vale, Gracias
Hola, soy principiante y necesito hacer una pregunta, Tengo una VM con sistema operativos OpenSuse y solamente se puede manejar por SSH si no estoy mal es por consola, y mi pregunta es como se puede la forma de ver, es decir para que se pueda visualizar.
No exactamente, puedes utilizarlo como hosting, tenier tu domino y todo, al final todas las nubes te dejan hacer el hosting, solo es un poquito mas difícil dominarlo que los servicios convencionales.
Google cloud es un hosting?
Hola, normalmente todo se puede hacer, el problema es como hacerlo, o se desarrolla una plataforma desde cero o se trata de implementar alguna plataforma open source como moodle. todo depende de la necesidad y quizá presupuesto. saludos !
Hola tengo una duda, se puede realizar un sitio e-learning desde Google Cloud??
Cuando llego a tener una me llega al correo que ingresé, previamente al crear la cuenta de facturación debiste poner los datos correctos, te adjuntan un documento con la factura, también se guarda en menu -&gt; facturación -&gt; documentos
Hola buen dia<br />Tengo un proyecto en esta plataforma y tengo duda de como descargar las facturas ya que solo me manda recibos de pago y esos no me sirven fiscalmente , podrias ayudarme?
me gustaria un video de como configurar Cpanel en google cloud
Por el momento solo puedo ir a un ritmo de un video por semana, entre cosas de datos desarrollo y nube, con google cloud estoy terminando unos ejemplos de kuberntes.
donde estan los videos siguientes
Hola Juan , no entiendo bien tu caso, el hosting donde estaba? en gcp? como es que tu pagina tiene contraseña tenias una aplicación como wordpress? si compraste un dominio recuerda que lo tienes que pagar cada año. espero que hayas echo el pago correspondiente
Hola DATACLOUDER empece como miembro del club desde Dicimbre de 2019 y todo iva bien con mi pagina web pero me dicen que no tengo ya el hosting y no puedo entrar a mi pagina con mi contraseña, desde tu experiencia que crees que paso, agradezco tu oportuna respuesta Gracias.
Hola Alex, en el trabajo a un colega le paso algo similar, subió las credenciales de gcp a proyecto de github PUBLICO, y de alguna manera alguién las tomó e hizo un mal uso, pienso que un bot, empezó a crear instancias para minar bitcoins, por póliticas esto esta prohibido, y google se da cuenta y termina desactivandote el proyecto. si tienes un caso similar cuida tus credenciales, tanto tu cuenta como las de servicio. de otra forma no se porque el mensaje.
@DATACLOUDER muchas gracias amigo y como hago para proteger las credendiales me ayudas por favor
@Alex Morales escencialmente es NO COMPARTIR el archivo .json de tus credenciales de servicio, para empezar te suena familar haberlas creado? , es la forma estandar de acceder a los rescursos, mientras las credenciales tengan privilegios, pero no es la única quizá le diste permisos a otra cuenta o quizá de plano te hackearon, es un caso extraño , pero borrar el proyecto y crea otro nuevo, cambia de contraseña, entiende poquito más sobre lo que haces en la nube. no deberías tener ese tipo de problemas.
Saludos porque Google cloud me bloquea la instancia.. diciéndome que está con minería criptomoneda y yo nose ni que significa eso o nose donde lo elimino.. me ayudas por favor
Sería una medida de seguridad, pero no, en realidad es automático, cada mes primero desquita lo que es gratis, y luego factura lo que te pasaste.
@DATACLOUDER Gracias por tu respuesta! repasaré tus videos
Hola Adamo, una pregunta, ¿Y si solo quiero usar los productos gratuitos sin pagar nada mensual? Tendría que poner como monto de presupuesto 0 dólares?
Hola Marco, gracias por el interes, sobre plataformas Coursera tiene los cursos oficiales de Google para certificarse, la más básica se llama Ingeniero asociado (puedes empezar por aquí), luego puedes decidir un rama en particular para tomar otra certificacion profesional, las hay como Desarrollador, Seguridad, Arquitectura o Ingeniería de datos, (son bien pagadas) los mejores cursos los he visto en <a href="http://acloudguru.com/">acloudguru.com</a> tienen una calidad tremenda para temas de cloud, la cosa es que para las certificaciones duras van de la mano con experiencia real en una empresa que adopte GCP como su nube, si sabes muy poco empieza a desarrollar, algo de Java Script, usa firebase, despliega una aplicación sencilla, implementa un mini proyecto. luego conecta con un backend en tu lenguaje de preferencia, aunque si usas python tendrás una ventaja cuando uses productos de AI, despliega en appengine (deja kubernetes para el final), saludos
@DATACLOUDER Muchas gracias Adamo! la info que me das es muy valiosa ya que me orienta más, tomaré tus consejos. Mil gracias!
Hola Adamo!, estoy empezando a aprender GCP y como veras estoy perdido jajaj más o menos. Y estoy empezando a buscar información y a aprender cada vez más. Te sigo en tu blog también (Hay buena información), mi pregunta en base a tu experiencia es, ¿Qué curso me recomiendas llevar para aprender GCP desde cero a tener un buen nivel y en que plataforma? Espero tu respuesta. Gracias! seguiré viendo tus videos
Cuanto se paga cuanto es la cuota mensual ?
si <a href="https://twitter.com/dataclouder">https://twitter.com/dataclouder</a>

AMIGO SALUDO, SOY D E VEZUELA, ME PODRIA AYUDAR CON UNA CUENTA VERIFICADA. NO TENGO TARJETA DE CREDITO YO LE PAGARIA POR PAYPAL. O ALGUIEN ACA POR FAVOR. SALUDO
Muy interesan. Ahora, al finalizar el registro me dan la API, para por ejemplo registrarla en donde la pueda llegar a necesitar. <br />Gracias por su respuesta.
Hola, tengo una pregunta, si uso la f1 micro y le instalo un juego (paladins, peso 24gb ram 2) puedo usarla sin que me cobren y cuanto tiempo puedo utilizarla sin que me cobren... Espero pueda responderme, gracias.
No puepo activar ninguna cuenta google cloud no acepta ninguna tarjeta ni de debito ni de credito
Hola no deberías cambiar los Nameservers que te arroja Google Cloud, por que estos son los que indican a que servidor apunta, si los cambias estarías apuntando a otro servidor por fuera de GCP y obviamente no podrías acceder a lo que ya instalaste previamente. Te recomiendo restablecer los valores iniciales de Nameservers y ahí podrás acceder nuevamente. Saludos
​@Pietti Nunca me llegó esta notificación de tu respuesta...ahora ya estoy un poco más familiarizado y entiendo mejor...el problema surgió desde que no pude modificar el EMAIL de administrador de wordpress entonces de tanto investigar di con la información de que los puertos de salida de EMAIL están bloqueados por CGP, por lo tanto nunca llega el correo de verificación del cambio de EMAIL de wordpress(desde ahí se hace una cadena de desastres en configuración del sitio y de plugins etc.)...no entiendo por qué al comprar el dominio no se puede respetar los nameservers y correr la instalación con GCP para tener el EMAIL coorporativo y el reenvío/alias de EMAIL que incluye google domains.<br />Ni siquiera con SMTP permite la salida del EMAIL al final tuve que usar SMTP junto con la API oAuth dentro de la misma cuenta de GCP.<br />Sabes si agregando los registros MX al dns de GCP la instancia de wordpress permita la salida de EMAIL?<br />Tengo muchos problemas aún con eso del EMAIL no entiendo por qué algo tan simple se tenga que convertir en algo tan tedioso...se supone que lo hacen para evitar el spam desde sus IP y no quemarlas pero esto me hace querer contratar otro host convencional.<br /><br />Ahora estoy investigando sobre CLOUD IDENTITY dentro del mismo GCP que sirve para crear una identidad corporativa a partir de un dominio y puedes crear los EMAILS corporativos que necesites sin costo, pero aún no termino de probarlo porque al final tienes que migrar todos tus proyectos a esa nueva cuenta de CLOUD IDENTITY.
@RL STATE por defecto los puertos para envió de correos están bloqueados, la alternativa a esto es enviar los correos por por SMTP, para esto hay varios plugins que lo hacen y los puedes configurar de manera fácil y rápida. Una vez configurado correctamente puedes cambiar el correo de tu administrador y este enviara la notificación correspondiente. Saludos
@Pietti ahora estoy probando con otro proyecto en CLOUD IDENTITY para tener email corporativo.<br />Con el proyecto anterior aún usando un SMTP seguía sin salida porque quería usar el SMTP de Gmail y evitar usar un cliente externo (estaba por usar mailgun). Pero mi terquedad era querer usar un EMAIL corporativo (cosa que Google domains me quitó por cambiar los DNS y no usar G Suite o bluehost) para la salida de emails y la administración de WordPress y es lo que ahora voy a probar ya teniendo CLOUD IDENTITY.<br />Igual había visto una alternativa usando otro puerto en firewall de GCP que se supone permite la salida de email.<br />Buenos tutoriales, saludos.
QUISE EDITAR LOS DNS CREADOS EN CLOUD POR LOS DNS QUE ARROJA GOOGLE DOMAINS POR DEFAULT PERO ME SALE UNA:<br />Advertencia: Tus registros de NS no coinciden con los servidores de nombres de tu zona. Esto no es habitual y podría causar problemas.<br /><br />AHORA YA NO PUEDO ENTRAR A WORDPRESS, PONGO LA IP ESTÁTICA QUE SE CREO Y NADA, NI CON LOS LINKS QUE SALEN DIRECTAMENTE EN LA INSTANCIA PARA ADMINISTRAR WORDPRESS.
Te cobra según el uso, ya sea de transferencia, trafico, almacenamiento, ram, etc etc...pero tienen una zona gratuita por siempre como para proyectos ligeros, con forme lo usas te vas dando cuenta de todo y lo vas conociendo.
@RL STATE sabes si me ayuda google cloud gold a que las páginas carguen rápido cuando están colapsadas???
Según yo tengo entendido que no te cobraría nada durante los primeros meses de prueba (12 como se menciona en este video) siempre y cuando no se realicen demasiadas llamadas a la API de Google Maps para que no supere tu cuota de transferencia (no sé cuál sea). Es decir, en los primeros meses de prueba y con los créditos que te regala google debería de ser suficiente para tu proyecto. Superado el periodo de prueba, tal como se menciona en el video y en GCP, no se realizarán cobros automáticos. Saludos espero haberte ayudado.
Cuanto te cobran google cuando tu prueba gratuita finaliza???? solo uso los mapas para la sección de contacto de mi web. Cuanto costaria ???
que zona horaria escogo si soy de Mexico?? :(
Genial!
Gracias Marstro

@Costi Thank you for your input and you are 100% right, this is definitely common sense that could be applied to many companies. I am sorry to hear you did not have a good experience at Google. My number one recommendation is to provide feedback if you can, it is taken seriously. If you had a bad interview it will not get fixed if you do not share what happened to you. Thank you for your comment.
@yichen wang good luck!
@Jaspreet Kaur TAM roles are a mix of technical skills and collaboration. You need to have the foundational program management skills and be able to problem solve with clients. I know this is super high level, I hope it helps!
Hi Everyone! GCP hiring has not slowed down and I thought this video would help anyone considering interviewing for a Google Cloud (GCP) role. This video just scratches the surface, let me know in the comments below if follow up videos are needed, thanks!
Get $300 and start running workloads for free → <a href="http://goo.gle/3qIykzS">http://goo.gle/3qIykzS</a>
Get started for free. New customers get $300 in free credits to spend on Google Cloud. All customers get free usage of 20+ products up to monthly limits. → <a href="http://goo.gle/3tcZtwx">http://goo.gle/3tcZtwx</a>
They have some crossovers but I think of it like this:<br /><br />Machine learning engineer = combination of data scientist and data engineer, can find insights in data and also deploy them to be used by businesses or customers<br />Data engineer = knows somewhat about using data to gather insights but specialises in creating the infrastructure to build data science pipelines, this usually involves, ingesting data, transforming it and using it to deliver a product or service<br />Data scientist = specialist in getting insights out of data to inform others (usually a team or client) about how a product or service is operating/could be improved<br /><br />Would you like to see a video/article on this in the future?

@Luisito Blanco debes utilizar el comando completo y no debes tener ningún problema sudo nano /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/wp-config.php. Siempre y cuando estés utilizando la version de Bitnami. Saludos
@Yasdancer depende de que version estés utilizando por ejemplo para editar el archivo wp-config.php en Google Click to Deploy seria: &quot;sudo nano /var/www/html/wp-config.php&quot;. Saludos
@Doramas Peru debes configurar el Registro A y CNAME en el la Zona DNS de Google Cloud, y debes colocar los 4 Nameservers proporcionados por GCP en tu registrador de dominio y debes esperar que se propague correctamente los registros DNS. Saludos

@mikigaymer Clashofclan Hola, este VPS no consume crédito. PEro si estás más seguro es como dices. Create las cuentas necesarias y vas a tener los VPS que desees. 😉
@mikigaymer Clashofclan Supongo que te referis si sacas otra cuenta. No, podes usar la misma. Yo tengo dos cuentas, una del blog y otra para crear los videos. Las dos usan la misma tarjeta de credito.
Hola, no se de que lugar me escribes. Pero aquí en Argentina no piden esos datos, solamente un número de tarjeta de crédito o débito colo se muestra en el video. Deberías enviar una consulta a Google para que puedan aclarar tus dudas. En cada región las políticas financieras cambian. Saludos.
@mikigaymer Clashofclan por lo que leo en esta cadena también eres ​ @José Miguel Lebrero Nunez Desconozco que cosa quieres hacer para no poner tus datos reales en la cuenta de pago. Pero por empezar te aconsejo que trates de no mezclar las cuentas porque va a ser sencillo de vincularte. Por otro lado, si quieres sacar una cuenta de usuario con otra residencia deberías usar una VPN para poder elegir desde donde conectar la cuenta. Pero mas allá de todo eso, la tarjeta de crédito o débito que utilices para vincular la cuenta te va a identificar con tu residencia postal por lo que supongo que si hay alguna reglamentación financiera en particular entre Google y España, te van a seguir pidiendo datos extras. Y si detectan maniobras sospechosas como estas que te comento y las que planteas creo que te vas a comprar un problema. Fijate en la cadena de comentarios que contesté a otro visitante un sitio web donde puedes sacar una tarjeta de crédito virtual con la que puedes abrir tu cuenta en GCP. Saludos desde Argentina!

Hi Nitin, it is not impossible to get job as a fresher after completing this certification. However, only 10% jobs are allotted for the freshers and companies expect you to have a very crisp knowledge on the topic and also must have a good hands on with GCP. You must have a sound knowledge on the basics of Data Structure and Networking.<br /><br />But, you can start doing internships and gain experience if things don&#39;t go your way. Thanks.

@Carlos Lr si, pero más bien a partir de ese momento deja de agregar cargos, si tenias un costo pendiente del mes pasado lo tendrás que pagar.
